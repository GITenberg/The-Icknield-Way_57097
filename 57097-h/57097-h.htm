<span class="smaller">TO HARRY HOOTON</span></h2>

</div>

<p>When I sat down at the “Dolau Cothi Arms” this
evening I remembered my dedication to you.
You said I could dedicate this book to you if I
would make a real dedication, not one of my
shadowy salutes befitting shadows rather than
men and women. It seems odd you should ask thus
for a sovereign’s worth of&mdash;shall I say&mdash;English
prose from a writer by trade. But though I turn
out a large, if insufficient, number of sovereigns’
worths, and am become a writing animal, and could
write something or other about a broomstick, I do
not write with ease: so let that difficulty give the
dedication its value.</p>

<p>It is right that I should remember you upon
a walk, for I have walked more miles with you
than with anyone else except myself. While I
walked you very often danced, on the roads of
Kent, Sussex, Surrey, and Hampshire. This evening
when I went out on the Sarn Helen everybody
was in chapel, I think, unless it was the Lord, for he
also seemed to me to be walking in the cool. I was
very much alone, and glad to be. You were a
ghost, and not a man of fourteen stone, and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
thought that perhaps after all that shadowy salute
would be fittest. But I have put my pen to paper:
I have set out and I will come to an end; for, as
I said, I am a writing animal. In the days of those
old walks I could have written a dedication in
Norfolk jacket style, all about “the open road,”
and the search for something “over the hills and
far away”: I should have reminded you at some
length how Borrow stayed at this inn, and that
Dolau Cothi is the house where he could have lived
with satisfaction “if backed by a couple of thousands
a year.” To-day I know there is nothing beyond
the farthest of far ridges except a signpost to unknown
places. The end is in the means&mdash;in the sight
of that beautiful long straight line of the Downs in
which a curve is latent&mdash;in the houses we shall
never enter, with their dark secret windows and quiet
hearth smoke, or their ruins friendly only to elders
and nettles&mdash;in the people passing whom we shall
never know though we may love them. To-day I
know that I walk because it is necessary to do so
in order both to live and to make a living. Once
those walks might have made a book; now they
make a smile or a sigh, and I am glad they are in
ghostland and not fettered in useless print. This
book for you was to have been a country book,
but I see that it has turned out to be another of
those books made out of books founded on other
books. Being but half mine it can only be half
yours, and I owe you an apology as well as a dedication.
It is, however, in some ways a fitting book
for me to write. For it is about a road which begins<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
many miles before I could come on its traces and
ends miles beyond where I had to stop. I could
find no excuse for supposing it to go to Wales and
following it there into the Ceidrych Valley, along
the Towy to Caermarthen, and so to St. David’s
which is now as holy as Rome, though once only a
third as holy. Apparently no special mediæval use revived
it throughout its course, or gave it a new entity
like that of the Pilgrims’ Way from Winchester to
Canterbury that you and I walked on many a time&mdash;by
the “Cock” at Detling, the “Black Horse”
at Thurnham, the “King’s Head” (once, I believe,
the “Pilgrims’ Rest”) at Hollingbourne, above
Harrietsham, past Deodara Villas, above Lenham
and Robert Philpot’s “Woodman’s Arms,” and
so on to Eastwell; always among beech and yew
and Canterbury bells, and always over the silver
of whitebeam leaves. I could not find a beginning
or an end of the Icknield Way. It is thus a symbol
of mortal things with their beginnings and ends
always in immortal darkness. I wish the book
had a little more of the mystery of the road about it.
You at least will make allowances&mdash;and additions;
and God send me many other readers like you.
And as this is the bottom of the sheet, and ale is
better than ink, though it is no substitute, I label
this “Dedication,” and wish you with me inside
the “Dolau Cothi Arms” at Pumpsaint, in Caermarthenshire.</p>

</div>


<p>I have to acknowledge the very great kindness of
Mr. Hilaire Belloc, Mr. Harold T. E. Peake, and
Mr. R. Hippisley Cox while I was writing this
book, though I do so with some hesitation, because
I may seem to make them responsible for
some of my possible mistakes and certain shortcomings.
A man could hardly have three better guides than Mr. Belloc
for his grasp and sympathy
with roads, Mr. Peake for his caution and curiosity,
and “documents, documents!” and Mr. Cox for
his ardour and familiarity with trodden turf; and
I must add my testimony to that of my betters
to the merits of Mr. Belloc’s <cite>Old Road</cite>, Mr. Peake’s
chapter on prehistoric roads in <cite>Memorials of Old
Leicestershire</cite>, and Mr. Cox’s <cite>Avebury</cite>. To Mr.
Peake I am indebted not only for suggestions
that were invaluable to me, notably in the matter
of the Ridgeway and the Bishop of Cloyne’s pernicious
theory, but for the use of his copies of the
greater part of the materials of my second chapter.
I have also had great kindness from the Rev. E. H.
Goddard and Mr. W. Gough.</p>

</div>

<p>Much has been written of travel, far less of the road.
Writers have treated the road as a passive means
to an end, and honoured it most when it has been
an obstacle; they leave the impression that a road
is a connection between two points which only
exists when the traveller is upon it. Though there
is much travel in the Old Testament, “the way”
is used chiefly as a metaphor. “Abram journeyed,
going on still toward the south,” says the historian,
who would have used the same words had the
patriarch employed wings. Yet to a nomadic
people the road was as important as anything upon
it. The earliest roads wandered like rivers through
the land, having, like rivers, one necessity, to keep
in motion. We still say that a road “goes” to
London, as we “go” ourselves. We point out
a white snake on a green hill-side, and tell a man:
“That is going to Chichester.” At our inn we think
when recollecting the day: “That road must have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
gone to Strata Florida.” We could not attribute
more life to them if we had moving roads with
platforms on the sidewalks. We may go or stay,
but the road will go up over the mountains to
Llandovery, and then up again over to Tregaron.
It is a silent companion always ready for us, whether
it is night or day, wet or fine, whether we are calm
or desperate, well or sick. It is always going:
it has never gone right away, and no man is too late.
Only a humorist could doubt this, like the boy in
a lane who was asked: “Where does this lane go to,
boy?” and answered: “I have been living here
these sixteen years and it has never moved to my
knowledge.” Some roads creep, some continue
merely; some advance with majesty, some mount
a hill in curves like a soaring sea-gull.</p>

<p>Even as towns are built by rivers, instead of
rivers being conducted past towns, so the first
settlements grew up alongside roads which had
formerly existed simply as the natural lines of
travel for a travelling race. The oldest roads
often touch the fewest of our modern towns, villages,
and isolated houses. It has been conjectured that
the first roads were originally the tracks of
animals. The elephant’s path or tunnel through
the jungle is used as a road in India to-day, and in
early days the wild herds must have been invaluable
for making a way through forest, for showing
the firmest portions of bogs and lowland marshes,
and for suggesting fords. The herd would wind
according to the conditions of the land and to inclinations
of many inexplicable kinds, but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
winding of the road would be no disadvantage
to men who found their living by the wayside,
men to whom time was not money. Roads which
grew thus by nature and by necessity appear to
be almost as lasting as rivers. They are found
fit for the uses of countless different generations of
men outside cities, because, apart from cities and
their needs, life changes little. If they go out of
use in a new or a changed civilization, they may still
be frequented by men of the most primitive habit.
All over England may be found old roads, called
Gypsy Lane, Tinker’s Lane, or Smuggler’s Lane;
east of Calne, in Wiltshire, is a Juggler’s Lane;
and as if the ugliness of the “uggle” sound pleased
the good virtuous country folk, they have got a
Huggler’s Hole a little west of Semley and south
of Sedgehill in the same county: there are also
Beggar’s Lanes and roads leading past places
called Mock Beggar, which is said to mean Much
Beggar. These little-used roads are known to
lovers, thieves, smugglers, and ghosts. Even if
long neglected they are not easily obliterated.
On the fairly even and dry ground of the high
ridges where men and cattle could spread out wide
as they journeyed, the earth itself is unchanged
by centuries of traffic, save that the grass is made
finer, shorter, paler, and more numerously starred
with daisies. But on the slopes down to a plain or
ford the road takes its immortality by violence,
for it is divided into two or three or a score of narrow
courses, trenched so deeply that they might often
seem to be the work rather of some fierce natural<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
force than of slow-travelling men, cattle, and
pack-horses. The name Holloway, or Holway, is
therefore a likely sign of an old road. So is Sandy
Lane, a name in which lurks the half-fond contempt
of country people for the road which a good “hard
road” has superseded, and now little used save
in bird’s-nesting or courting days. These old roads
will endure as long as the Roman streets, though
great is the difference between the unraised trackway,
as dim as a wind-path on the sea, and the straight
embanked Roman highway which made the proverb
“Plain as Dunstable Road,” or “Good plain
Dunstable”&mdash;for Watling Street goes broad and
straight through that town. Scott has one of these
ghostly old roads in <cite>Guy Mannering</cite>. It was over
a heath that had Skiddaw and Saddleback for
background, and he calls it a <i>blind road</i>&mdash;“the track
so slightly marked by the passengers’ footsteps
that it can but be traced by a slight shade of verdure
from the darker heath around it, and, being only
visible to the eye when at some distance, ceases
to be distinguished while the foot is actually treading
it.”</p>

<p>The making of such roads seems one of the
most natural operations of man, one in which
he least conflicts with nature and the animals.
If he makes roads outright and rapidly, for a
definite purpose, they may perish as rapidly, like
the new roads of modern Japanese enterprise,
and their ancient predecessors live on to smile at
their ambition. These are the winding ways
preferred by your connoisseur to-day. “Give me,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
says Hazlitt, “the clear blue sky over my head
and the green turf beneath my feet, a winding road
before me, and a three-hours’ march to dinner&mdash;and
then to thinking!” These windings are created
by the undulating of the land, and by obstacles
like those of a river&mdash;curves such as those in the
High Street of Oxford, which Wordsworth called
“the stream-like windings of that glorious street.”
The least obstacle might bring about a loop, if
nothing more, and as even a Roman road curled
round Silbury Hill, so the path of the Australian
savage is to be seen twisting round bush after
bush as if it enjoyed the interruption, though
it cannot purl like the river at a bend.
Probably these twists, besides being unconsciously
adapted to the lie of the land, were,
as they are still, easeful and pleasant to the rover
who had some natural love of journeying. Why go
straight? There is nothing at the end of any road
better than may be found beside it, though there
would be no travel did men believe it. The straight
road, except over level and open country, can only
be made by those in whom extreme haste and forethought
have destroyed the power of joy, either at
the end or at any part of its course. Why, then, go
straight? The connoisseur had something of the
savage in him when he demanded a winding road.</p>

<p>It is not, however, to a man walking for pleasure
that we shall go for a sense of roads, but to one like
Bunyan. <cite>Pilgrim’s Progress</cite> is full of the sense of
roads. See Christian going to Mr. Legality’s house.
It is a mountain road, and the hill overhangs it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
so much that he is afraid to venture further “lest
the hill should fall on his head.” When Goodwill
points out the narrow way, he says it was “cast
up by the patriarchs, prophets, Christ, and his
Apostles,” i.e. made into a raised track bounded by
ditches from which the earth was cast up to form
the embankment. When Christian comes to the
Hill Difficulty you see the primitive man deciding
to go straight uphill, turning not to the left by the
way called Danger into a great wood, nor to the
right to Destruction and the “wide field full of
dark mountains.” How full of plain English
country wayfaring is the passage where Hopeful
and Christian take a road by a river-side, and then
when it turns away from the water they see a stile
leading into a path which keeps on, as a path would
do, along the bank through By-path Meadow:
only, as it happens, the river is in flood and they
must turn back again towards the stile. This man
knew roads, and one of his temptations after conversion
was to try his faith by bidding the puddles
on the road between his own village and Bedford to
be dry. Cervantes had the sense of roads. He
begins, indeed, by making Don Quixote sally forth
“upon the plain” like any knight of chivalry
“pricking o’er the plain” and taking the way
chosen by his horse because thus would adventures
best be compassed; but it is upon a road that
he and most of his knights, ladies, and enchanters
travel. Malory’s book would have less vitality
in its marvel if it were not for the roads: the three
highways, for example, where Sir Marhaus and Sir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
Gawaine and Sir Uwaine were to separate for their
adventures each with his damosel; and the wild
ways of Sir Launcelot when he “rode many wild
ways, throughout marches and many wild ways,”
until he came to a valley and a knight therein with
a naked sword chasing a lady. <cite>Cymbeline</cite> again,
and some of the historical plays of Shakespeare,
give a grand impression of wide tracts of country
traversed by roads of great purpose and destiny.</p>

<p>More often in books we move, as I have said,
from place to place as in a dream. But it is a dream
in the <cite>Mabinogion</cite> which gives one of the most
majestic scenes of travel. I mean the dream of the
Emperor Maxen. He dreamed that he was journeying
along a river valley towards its source, and up
over the highest mountain in the world until he
saw mighty rivers descending to the sea, and one
of them he followed to a great city at its mouth and
a vast castle in the city. At the end of his journey
the dreaming Emperor found a girl so beautiful that
when he awoke he could think of naught else, while
years went by, except her beauty. He sent out
pioneers to discover the road of his dream, and at
last they brought him to the castle and the same
girl Helen sitting in the hall of it. She became his
bride, and he gave her three castles&mdash;one at Arvon
in North Wales, one at Caerleon, and one at Caermarthen
in the South. Then, says the tale, “Helen
bethought her to make high-roads from one castle
to another throughout the Island of Britain. And
the roads were made. And for this cause are they
called the roads of Helen Luyddawc, that she was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
sprung from a native of this island, and the men of
the Island of Britain would not have made these
great roads for any save her.” It is natural to connect
with this Helen the great ancient roads leading
north and south across Wales known as Sarn Helen
or Elen. Nothing could be more noble as the name
of a mountain road than Sarn Helen or Helen’s
Causeway. It suggests to the ordinary fanciful and
unhistoric mind the British Helena, mother of the
Emperor Constantine, and that it suggested this
long ago is clear from the old identification of Helen
Luyddawc with the only child of King Cole of
Colchester. The name has more recently been explained
as Sarn y Lleng, the Road of the Legions.
Sir John Rhys<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> insists upon Elen instead of Helen,
and believes her to be one of the pagan goddesses
of the dusk. “There is,” he says, “a certain
poetic propriety in associating the primitive paths
and roads of the country with this vagrant goddess
of dawn and dusk.” These wandering paths are to
the hard white highways what dusk is to the full
blaze of day. First perhaps trodden by the wild
herd and still without terrors for it, they might well
be protected by a sort of Artemis, goddess of wildernesses
and of forked ways, kind both to human
hunters and the wild quarry. They belong to the
twilight of the world. No doubt the sun shines no
brighter at noon than it did then on a perfectly
wild earth, on flowers that were never gathered, on
bright plumage that no man had coveted. But all
the forest and marsh of primeval earth form in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
imagination mists to which the lack of history adds
yet another veil. These mists lie over the world, to
my mind, exactly as the white mist of summer lies,
turning into a sea most of what once was land and
making islands of the woods on the steep, uncultivated
tracts. The islands rising out of the mists of time
are the hills and mountains, and along their ridges
ran the first roads, and by them are the squares and
circles of the first habitations and the mounds of the
first solemnized graves, used sometimes, it is thought,
as guides for travellers.</p>

<p>It is particularly easy to think of Southern England
as several chains of islands, representing the Downs,
the Chilterns and Gog Magogs, the Mendips, Cotswolds
and Quantocks. I have more than once
caught myself thinking of the broad elephantine
back of Butser Hill heaving up, spotted with gorse
but treeless, between Petersfield and Portsmouth,
as Ararat, though my unfaithful eyes fail to imagine
the ark. There are days now when the clear suddenly
swelling hills like Tarberry or Barrow Hill
in Hampshire, or Cley Hill or the Knolls of Maiden
Bradley in Wiltshire, or the abrupt promontories like
Chanctonbury or Noar Hill near Selborne, or the
long trooping ranges, seem to be islands or atolls
looming dimly through the snowy still mists of
morning or the clouds of rainstorm. Even without
mist some of the isolated green hills rise out of the
pale levels of cornland as out of sea; and I have
seen, from near Bruton, the far-distant mass of
Cadbury, the hill some call Camelot in Somerset,
look like a dark precipitous isle. When the early<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
roads along the ridges were made, the hills still more
closely resembled islands emerging out of the forest
and out of the marsh. The watersheds created the
roads, as they still do over hundreds of miles in
Africa. The roads keep to the highland, and if this
highland were to form a circle they would follow it;
and hunters say, as Mr. H. W. Nevinson tells us in
<cite>A Modern Slavery</cite>, that the elephants do “move
in a kind of rough zone or circle&mdash;from the Upper
Zambesi across the Cuando into Angola and the
district where they passed me, and so across the
Cuanza northward and eastward into the Congo,
and round towards Katanga and the sources of the
Zambesi again.” Somewhere too I have met the
tradition, probably a Welsh one, that this island
of Britain was girdled by a road above its shores.
The early nomads would descend from the ridges
only with reluctance, for fear of the marsh and the
dim forest. Doubtless their travelling oxen, especially
if burdened, had the same horror of mud&mdash;when
they are not free to wallow in it&mdash;as they
have to-day. In a very early age it is likely that
men would go down to the rivers only to water their
cattle, and then return to the heights. There would
be several drinking-places, and at one of them they
would discover a ford, unless the animals had already
marked one, and then if the river had not become
a boundary they might cross and continue their
wanderings along a road upon the next island of
hills. Thus island would be joined to island. The
paths ran along the back of each one and branched
over the spurs, and the linking up of these would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
tend to form highways of great length, like that
trodden by Launcelot, “far o’er the long backs of
the bushless downs” to Camelot. It were easy
to take such a route to-day from anywhere in Berkshire
or Hampshire, travelling high and away from
cities, except cities of the dead like Avebury, far from
towns and villages, through Wiltshire into Somerset
or Dorset, on roads which are altogether turf or have
so goodly a border of grass and blossom that the
wayfarer need never touch the hard white grit
which is the same on a metalled road whether in
London or in wild country.</p>

</div>

<p>Down from the realm-long bridge of islands above<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
the world the traveller descended to cities of men.
Thus Sir Launcelot after long riding in a great forest
came into a low country of fair rivers and meadows
and saw before him the long bridge and the three
pavilions on it, “of silk and sendal of divers hue.”
Thus Sir Bevis of Hampton, cheated of his patrimony
by a cruel mother and keeping sheep on the
Downs, looked and saw below him the town and the
tower that should have been his. Thus Cobbett,
looking from Portsdown Hill above Portsmouth,
saw the sea for the first time and the English fleet
riding at anchor at Spithead and his heart “was
inflated with national pride,” and though he had
walked thirty miles that day he slept not a moment,
but rose at daylight and offered himself for the sea
on board the <i>Pegasus</i>. Thus we descend on Winchester
or Salisbury out of the hills, glad to get
there what we want as we have for many days
gladly wanted what we could get. It has been,
let us say, a day that should be spring, and in the
dark, wet copses there were thousands of primroses.
All day the wind, and often rain and wind together,
roared in the trees. The pale flowers were soaked
and frayed and speckled with dust from the trees,
and they hung down or were broken from their
soft stalks. But the high land and the neighbouring
sky exalt us. Even the sight of these tender-blubbering
petals ruined in the drenched grass was
pleasant. We should have liked better to see
them unspoiled and wide in the sun; but we did not
wish them to be so, and their distress did but add
to the glory of the storm and to our defiance, just as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
did the cowering of birds, of bowed trees, of whole
woods, under the wild, shadowy swoop of the mist and
rain, and the valleys below us humbled, their broad
fields, their upthrust churches and clustered villages
overwhelmed and blotted out, and everything annihilated
save the wind, the rain, the streaming road,
and the vigorous limbs and glowing brain and
what they created. Not that we did not welcome
freely the minutes of dimly shining stillness that
were as a secluded garden in a city, when the storm
paused; for then we drank in the blue sky and the
dark revealed tracts of plain and hill that lay
stunned and astonished like a dreamer opening his
eyelids after tumultuous dreams; we drank them
with easy joy as of a man reading a great adventure
when the heroes of it have long been dead, for we
ourselves were so much above all that expanse
which, powerless and quiet, might almost seem to
belong to the past or to a tale. We and the storm
were one and we were triumphant; and in mid
triumph we came down to the lighted streets.</p>

<p>As the first roads were made by men following
herds, either as hunters or as herdsmen, so ox and
sheep have long helped to keep them up. The
great road of pilgrimage from Damascus to Mecca
is not a made road, but composed of the parallel
strands of old hollow camel paths. These, says
Mr. Charles M. Doughty in <cite>Arabia Deserta</cite>, “one
of the ancient Arabian poets has compared to the
bars of the rayed Arabic mantle.” To our own day
in England drovers took the cattle lazily along the old
roads of the watersheds and ridges. “Ox Drove” is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
the name in several places of an old green road.
Travellers in Wiltshire have noticed on the one-inch
Ordnance Survey Map a “British Trackway”
running W.S.W. out of the road from the Deverills
to Maiden Bradley. A large tumulus stands in the
first field, as if for a sign at the beginning of the
track. Locally this is known as the “Ox Road,”
and is said to have been used by droves coming
from Mid and East Somerset. It is a continuation
of the hard road which it leaves at the tumulus,
and following it and its continuations you may
travel through Kilmington, and between the Jack’s
Castle tumulus and King Alfred’s tower, down
Kingsettle Hill, and on close to Cadbury Castle, to
Ilchester, and, joining the Foss Way, reach Devon
and Cornwall. Only one mile of its course is marked
in Old English letters “British Trackway,” and
this is apparently not even a path, but a protracted
unevenness of the ground, sometimes almost
amounting to a ridge or terrace in the grass, for
the most part following the hedges, and in one
place entering a short, nettly lane. The road, in
spite of its romantic Old English lettering, is at
this point a very humble specimen of an ancient
road and ox drove; for it goes through meadows
which are low compared with the fine waves of
Down&mdash;White Sheet Downs and the Maiden Bradley
Hills&mdash;on either side of it. A far better one is the
ox drove which this joins at Kilmington. It is said
to have been used as a road from London to Exeter.
Farmers will tell you that the Ox Drove “never
touched water,” which they will qualify by saying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
you could go from Monkton Deverill to Marlborough
without touching water or crossing it, and
if that also is impossible, at any rate they have
the tradition of the road’s character in their heads,
seldom as they may use it. Along it, says Mr.
J. U. Powell,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> came “fat cattle from the Somerset
pastures to London,” and once he thinks it was a
road leading to the lead of Somerset and tin of
Cornwall.</p>

<p>It goes through the orchards of Somerset as a
good hard road, but often deprived of its right
green borders. When these have been lost they
have not always disappeared, and its old breadth
is shown probably by a long, narrow field lying
first on one side and then, after a zigzag, on the
other, as near the “Bull” to the east of Bruton.
Sometimes with a green space beside the road, or a
depression behind the hedge, or an aimless avenue
of oak trees as at Redlynch, marking the old
course, it is a narrow road going in a determined
manner up and down, but with few deviations and
having a purpose obviously unconnected with the
few cottages on its edge. Here it is called the
Hardway. The “hard road” is the countryman’s
admiring term for a made road; but it is suggested
that the Hardway is the Har- or Harrow-Way, and
is a continuation of a road running east and west
through Hampshire and Wiltshire. It crosses the
little shaded river Brue and ascends Kingsettle
Hill between high banks of beech and oak and bluebell.
It mounts, like a savage who does not mind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
being out of breath, straight up the steep wooded
wall of the hill until at the top it is eight hundred
and fifty feet high instead of four hundred, and
takes you into Wiltshire. On the right is the huge
square tower of brick erected by one of the Colt
Hoare family in honour of King Alfred. The name
Kingsettle Hill was thought by Colt Hoare to
mark the pass of King Alfred when, with the chief
men of Somerset, he issued from Athelney “after
Eastertide,” in 878, and marched to Egbert’s stone
in the east part of Selwood Forest. This “stone”
or “cliff” has been supposed to be White Sheet Hill,
a very conspicuous and noble place for the King to
gather the people of Somerset, Wiltshire, and Hampshire
before leading them to the victory of Edington.
On the right and, like Alfred’s Tower, at the brink
of the hill is the big tumulus known as Jack’s
Castle; and from either you command Somersetshire
nearly as far as the curvature of the earth
allows. From the oaks and bluebells of the slopes
beneath you stretches a low subdivided country of
many oaks&mdash;and cuckoos calling from them&mdash;and the
Hardway penetrating it from the south-west. Colt
Hoare calls the tumulus “Selwood Barrow,” a beacon
above the great Forest of Selwood and possibly a
direction post for travellers from the west to Old
Sarum. In the north-west the land rises up to a
ridge with a comb of beech trees, which is Creech
Hill above Bruton, and at its feet the masses of
Pink Wood and Norridge Wood. The Mendips are
a dim cloud beyond it on the right, the Quantocks
a dimmer cloud on the left; and in the low<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
land between them is Athelney, and near it
Glastonbury, standing above the full-grown Brue.
Sometimes the wind-like sound of an invisible
train ascends.</p>

<p>The road takes you through the remains of Selwood
Forest. Now it has a fair green border, often
of considerable breadth. That you are in Wiltshire
there can be no doubt on emerging from the trees.
For in front upon the left are those gentle monsters,
the smooth Long and Little Knolls above Maiden
Bradley, smooth, detached green dunes crested and
fringed with beeches. Under this side of the Long
Knoll is the tower of Kilmington Church among its
trees. Lying across the road a few miles ahead are the
bare White Sheet Downs, which are to be mounted,
and farther to the right the wooded beacons above
Fonthill Gifford and East Knoyle. The road makes
for the scar of a high quarry on the nearest slope
of White Sheet, a little to the left of a lesser isolated
hill, a smooth, wooded knoll or islet. The road is
gently and evenly rising, a hard, white road almost
straight, between grassy borders with thorns and
brambles under beeches that overhang from behind
the hedge. They are good trees standing on a strip
of turf furrowed as if it had once been the road or
part of it; and some young ones have been lately
planted, so that all is not yet over with English
country, though landlords say so. The road crosses
another to Kilmington and Yarnfield, and at once
it is older-looking, hard, but winding slightly among
bushy and lush steep banks. You see flowers and
ash trees, and a linnet on the tip of one, but nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
distant save white clouds and the blue. Here it
is called Long Lane, and among its herbage is an
old London milestone. Long Lane is often the
title of a lane coming from somewhere afar off:
there is one south of Hermitage, giving its name
to a village, in Berkshire, and one near Cucklington
in Somerset, where there is a Tinker’s Hill also.
In another mile Long Lane crosses the Maiden
Bradley road by a smithy and a “Red Lion”;
its name becomes White Sheet Lane, and it goes
straight in sight of the high white quarry and the
deep tracks up to White Street Castle. Like Long
Lane, it is a parish boundary. Both are without a
house: the road has hardly passed a house since
Redlynch, save at a crossing, and those living in
the houses use the road only for a mile or so on the
way to a village on either side. Slanting uphill
under the quarry, with a parallel green way hollowed
beside it, goes the road’s bolder self. The hedges
and banks are low, and the cornland or meadow is
open round about. The lane turns to climb White
Sheet Hill, and beeches and some whitebeam trees
cool the beginning of the ascent; there are myriads
of primroses in their season and chaffinches singing.
You pass a thatched house and the lime-kiln of
“Tom Gatehouse, Lime Burner,” by the quarry,
and another milestone showing twenty-three miles
to Sarum and a date like 1757&mdash;when Blake was
born. Looking back, the Knolls are on the right
and Alfred’s Tower on the left among the woods.
There are tumuli on the right as the road comes
clear out on to the hill-top and travels between the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
wired fences of the downland pasture. Here stand
cows who do not often see a pencil sharpened.
Pewits wheel over and before and behind; all along
the high course of the road the pewits cry and
wheel. The road is at first rutted, but is soon a
green smooth track on the highest land, skirting
the upper ends of coombes dappled dusky gold
by gorse, and commanding bare downland on the
left and wooded hills on the right, and looking
along a great bottom to the church tower of
Mere, and Mere’s beautiful “Long Hill,” and the
wide-arboured vale stretching away to the long
ridge of Dorset. It is a high way and a proud way.
After crossing an ancient ditch it is labelled
“British Trackway,” and ahead it is seen going
between a wire fence and a dark line of tussocks.
Then it is divided into three or four parallel terraces
grooved by wheels, but with a lark’s nest in the
green rut. It crosses the Mere road as two hollow
ways side by side, but in a little while is only a
green track with single thorns on the left. Here is
the twenty-first milestone from Sarum, the ninety-ninth
from London, inscribed 1750, and it is called the
London Drove Road; it is still in sight of Alfred’s
Tower, now protruding above White Sheet ramparts.
In one place it is so wide that the milestone stands
out in the middle, like a traveller asleep or turned to
stone among mole-heaps that have blotted the signs
of other travellers. On the left, as far as the main
Wincanton road, part of the track is embanked;
entering the hard motor road to Amesbury and
London, the old way is outlined chiefly by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
thorns of Old Willoughby Hedge on the left. The
road going hedgeless across the downland is but
the thin backbone of the old green way. For a
time the line of thorns diverges, and then, soon
after the crossing of the Warminster road, they
come slanting from the right to meet the road
and cross it just before another milestone. Hereby
are three milestones on different roads, all
close together, which has caused the easy winning
of merry wagers to run past three milestones in
three minutes. The drove crosses several roads
going to Hindon, as a broad green track with or
without a hedge, marked by its greater profusion
of daisies and its paleness and lack of tussocks.
Still there are pewits, and somewhere not far away
a Pewit Castle. It is joined again by the main
Amesbury road beyond Cold Berwick Hill, but
presently deserted, the busier white way going
boldly off over the ridge, and down to the Wylye
River and up again on to Salisbury Plain by
Yarnbury, and so past Stonehenge to Amesbury.
The green road winds along the south slope of the
ridge. Now two lines of thorns show the course far
ahead, or the white weals of an ascent are seen;
now gorse encroaches on it, and at a crossway
corned-beef tins and grey embers mark an encampment
of nomads. It passes thickets of thorn and
wayfaring trees burying an old milestone to Sarum.
Turf or corn lies on either hand or on both. It
keeps along the edge of Groveley Woods and within
sound of the nightingales until it bends down to
Salisbury; once probably it or a higher parallel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
course went over a ford to Old Sarum, and evidently
it is vastly older than the eighteenth-century milestones,
perhaps old enough to have guided the
Hampshire men and some of the Wiltshiremen to
Alfred, a road such as Cobbett loved for the hammering
of horses’ hoofs on flints.</p>

<p>Another fine ox drove, and dignified by that
name and by old lettering on the Ordnance Map, ran
clear for a long stretch along the high land south
of the Ebble River, from a point four miles south of
Salisbury and westwards by Winkelbury to the
south of Shaftesbury. It may some day be proved
that one of the most famous of ancient roads, the
Icknield Way itself, was an ox drove. There is said
to be a charter mentioning the Icknield Way as “the
way the cattle go”; and one writer has boldly
derived the very name from the British Yken, or
Ychen, meaning oxen. Every district in the chalk
country has its tradition of an old road, now surviving
in a footpath or in broken vertebræ of lane
and footpath to provide walkers with endless
theories. At Swindon, for example, it is said<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> that
the Holy Well stood on a road coming from the east
and going westward past Bradenstoke Abbey into
Somerset, and on another used by pilgrims to the
shrine of St. Anne’s in the Wood, at Brislington in
Somerset, which went by Elcombe, Hay Lane
Bridge, Bushton, Clyffe, Calne, Studley, Chippenham,
Pewsham Forest, Bradford, Keynsham Abbey,
and Whitchurch, to Brislington, which is in the
south-east of Bristol and has now a station called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
St. Ann’s Park. But this is not the place to give
way to the fascination of a roll-call of country
names.</p>

<p>Except that bridges superannuated fords, the
conditions for the travelling of cattle cannot have
changed much from Alfred’s time until the day of
railway trucks carrying thickets of moaning horns
and square blocks of sheep. The turnpike system
helped to preserve the old roads because drovers
using them could avoid the tolls; their cattle could
also feed by the wayside. Canon Jackson,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> in 1862,
said that the Ridgeway of Berkshire and Wiltshire
was part of the road used for ages and to this day
for driving cattle from Anglesey into Kent. Mr.
Walter Money, in a note to Miss Gossett’s <cite>Shepherds
of Britain</cite>, said much the same thing. Unfortunately
neither has told us anything of their route.
I have no doubt they could have covered most of the
distance on grass. I should like to have travelled
with them. You will find “Welsh Ways” all over
England. Walkers or Workaway Hill, where the
Ridgeway descends southward from Wansdyke to
the Pewsey Valley, is said to be a corruption of
Weala-wege, and to have been called Walcway (or
Welshway) by a shepherd not long ago. There is
a “Welshway” in Northamptonshire making past
Northampton for Wales by way of Banbury and
the Cotswolds, and said to have been the route of
Welsh drovers. There is a “Welsh Lane” in the
Cotswolds turning out of the Gloucester road, three
or four miles from Cirencester, and going up the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
hill by Four Mile Bottom towards Barnsley. I met
an old man who remembered helping the Welsh
drovers with their black cattle there sixty years
ago. They were putting up near by for the night,
and they liked the boy because his name was David.
In the downland these roads would be practicable
for the most part all the year round; but Defoe
tells us that the clay roads of the Midlands used to
be so bad that graziers sold their stock in September
and October: they could then be taken to the
neighbourhood of London and kept until mid-winter
to be sold at a high price. Cheshire men
used to send their cheese to London either all the
way by sea or overland to Burton, and so by the
river to Hull and thence by sea. Gloucester men
sent their goods by land to Lechlade or Cricklade,
and then onward by the Thames; but their flocks
doubtless could travel by Bath and go along the
down ways eastward. But he says that now the
roads are good, and mutton comes straight from the
country in December, and almost as cheap as in
summer.</p>

</div>

<p>I have not had the fortune to meet drovers from
Wales, but where the Icknield Way through Buckinghamshire
rounds the promontory Beacon of the
Ivinghoe Hills I have seen men with sheep from
Berkshire or Dorset journeying towards Dunstable,
Royston, and the farms of Cambridgeshire and
Suffolk. They have to go much on the hard grit
to-day, and I have heard that they are kept off the
unfenced Ridgeway lest the flock should eat too
much of the pastures in their passage. The sheep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
dislike the grit as much as Mr. Burroughs loves it
and I hate it, and what with the traffic and the
harshness of the road it is not surprising to hear of
a Welsh flock taking a week to get from Warminster
to Monckton Deverill.</p>

<p>Where the high down roads are fenced there
could be no better wayfaring. The track is twenty
or thirty yards wide or more. It is untouched
by wheels, and grows nothing but grass and the
most delicate flowers. Along similar droves doubtless
the sheep go up to the alpine grass in summer,
as the shepherd in California told Miss Mary Austin.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
“We went between the fenced pastures, feeding
every other day and driving at night. In the dark
we heard the bells ahead and slept upon our feet.
Myself and another herdboy, we tied ourselves together
not to wander from the road.... Whenever
shepherds from the Rhone are met about
camps in the Sierras they will be talking of how
they slept upon their feet and followed after the
bells.” The best time to meet travelling sheep is
after one of the fortnightly markets at East Ilsley
among the Berkshire Downs, or at the time of the
Ram Fair there on August 1st, or at the time of
Tan Hill Fair on August 6th, or Yarnbury Fair on
October 4th. Tan Hill and Yarnbury fairs are
both held within the circuit of an old camp on the
high chalk. Yarnbury is a meeting-place of trackways
over Salisbury Plain. Tan Hill is close to the
great Ridgeway and other trackways. Tan is
supposed by some to be connected with the Celtic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
“tan,” meaning fire, and with Celtic religious
festivals having ceremonies of fire. This fair was
held at a very early hour, and there is an obvious
temptation to suggest a religious origin for the
beacons said to have been lighted to guide the
drovers.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> I do not know what number of sheep
would be sold at this fair. Defoe says that as many
as five hundred thousand were sold at Weyhill
Fair, one farmer attending to represent ten or
twenty in his own county of Sussex or Oxfordshire.
If this number came to Tan Hill it was worth a
night’s drenching to see the beacons and the multitudes
arriving, to hear the bells and the sea of
tired bleating and the sharp chiding of the overstrung
dogs and the curses of the sleepy drovers
upon that smooth, bare mountain without house
or hut or a white road, or anything much newer
than Wansdyke except the square of mustard that
began to dawn through the mist like a banner not
far away.</p>

<p>The Arab’s answer to Mr. Doughty’s<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> question
whether he knew all the strange spires, pinnacles,
and battlements of the wind-worn sand rock in the
desert was that he knew, “as good as every great
stone” in all his marches over three or four thousand
square miles; and there were drovers who
could have said as much of the landmarks on the
downs, the tumulus and camp, the furze thicket,
the hawthorns, solitary or in line, the beech or fir
clump, the church tower, the distant white wall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
or scallop of a chalk-pit, the white horse carved
through the turf into the chalk, the church towers
of the valley, the long coombes.</p>

<p>Even when deserted, these old roads are kept in
memory by many signs. The grass refuses to grow
over the still stream of turf in the same way as at
either side of it. A line of thorn trees follows their
course, or the hedge or fence or wall dividing
two fields. They survive commonly and conspicuously
as boundaries between fields, between estates,
parishes, hundreds, and counties. It is one of the
adventurous pleasures of a good map thus to
trace the possible course of a known old road or to
discover one that was lost. A distinct chain of
footpath, lane, and road&mdash;road, lane, and footpath&mdash;leading
across the country and corresponding in
much of its course with boundaries is likely to be
an ancient way. By this means much of the line
of a road like the Icknield Way might be recovered
if document and tradition had not preserved it.
Without these signs few men to-day could tell an
old from a new road, though, in fact, there are not
many great lengths of entirely new road except in
new towns and newly drained regions; elsewhere
the new roads have been made by linking up or
improving old ones. The life of cities has destroyed
at once the necessity and the power to judge the
expanse of earth under our eyes, and few but
soldiers educate whatever gift they have for this
kind of judgment. If we learn to use a map, it is
without fundamental understanding, without the
savage’s or the soldier’s or the traveller’s grasp;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
we must have inherited glimmerings of the old
power, but they help us chiefly to an æsthetic
appreciation of landscape. Let a man take an old
map&mdash;not a very old one, which may be faulty or
deficient&mdash;of his own district, and see if he can
really grasp the system of the hills and rivers, and
the bones of the land and the essential roads, and
not be long baffled merely by the absence of certain
new roads and familiar names; for few old ones
will have entirely disappeared. If he is not so
baffled he has cause for pride. Many are to be
found who can hardly read a map when going from
north to south, i.e. down the map instead of up it,
with the east on the left and the west on the right
and the north behind; and their difficulty is increased
by being in a railway train. Such men
may be very good walkers and very good men,
though they be walking for exercise, or to improve
body or soul, which is a reason that has lately been
condemned by Mr. Belloc. “The detestable habit
of walking for exercise,” he tells us, “warps the
soul.”<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> He is perhaps assuming that the man
always keeps this one object in view, and is always
looking at his watch or feeling his pulse. But
even a man walking for exercise may forget his
object and unexpectedly profit; he may surprise
happiness by the wayside or beyond the third stile,
and no man can do more, whether he have the best
and the most Bellocian object in the world. Then
he condemns also men who ride along the road and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
into an inn yard and feel that they are “like some
one in a book.” This is a rather serious matter.
Authors have unintentionally persuaded simple
men to suffer many blisters for the chance of
drinking ale in the manner of Borrow and meeting
adventures, in the hope of being heartily and
Whitmanesquely democratic. Even Leslie Stephen
half-seriously lamented that he was unworthy of
Borrovian adventures; for they never fell to him.
A writer in the <cite>Gentleman’s Magazine</cite> has made a
good piece of prose in which he speaks of himself
reading the <cite>Essays of Elia</cite> in an old inn at Llandovery&mdash;as
Hazlitt read <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La Nouvelle Heloise</cite> at
Llangollen on his birthday. A great many must be
walking over England nowadays for the primary
object of writing books: it has not been decided
whether this is a worthy object. Mr. John Burroughs
also condemns a walk taken as a prescription,
but goes so far as to regard walking itself as a
virtue. He says that his countrymen “have fallen
from that state of grace which capacity to enjoy
a walk implies”; that they pride themselves on
small feet, though “a little foot never yet supported
a great character.” He says they could
“walk away from all their ennui, their worldly
cares, their uncharitableness, their pride of dress;
for these devils always want to ride, while the
simple virtues are never so happy as on foot.”
He concludes by singing “the sweetness of gravel
and good sharp quartz-grit.” He must be singing
the grit of yester-year, or he never walked all day
in the full blaze of summer upon the grit between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
Newmarket and Hitchin. Leslie Stephen thought
the true walker one to whom walking “is in itself
delightful”; he regarded walking as a panacea
for authors, and believed that it could have cured
Johnson and made Byron like Scott. A year or
two ago Mr. Harold Munro took a month across
France into Italy, for a part of the time putting
himself out of reach of letters&mdash;to prove to himself
that he could do it. There are plenty of adventures
in modern life, but we still crave for the conspicuous
ones which look so splendid when their heroes are
distant or in the grave. These are the only adven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>tures
which we deign to recognize as such, and
walking being a primitive act “natural to man,” as
Mr. Belloc says, we feel restored to a pristine majesty,
or Arcadianism at least, when we undertake it.
Perhaps if we walk long enough we shall discover
something about roads. There could be few better
objects for walking, unless it be to meet a mistress
or to fetch a doctor. We walk for a thousand
reasons, because we are tired of sitting, because we
cannot rest, to get away from towns or to get into
them, or because we cannot afford to ride; and
for permanent use the last is perhaps the best, as
it is the oldest.</p>

<p>Few in the multitude of us who now handle maps
are without some vague awe at the Old English
lettering of the names of ancient things, such as
Merry Maidens, Idlebush Barrow, Crugian Ladies,
or the plain Carn, Long Barrow, or Dolmen. Not
many could explain altogether why these are impressive.
We remember the same lettering in old
mysterious books, and in Scott’s <cite>Marmion</cite> and
Wordsworth’s <cite>Hartleap Well</cite>. We are touched in
our sense of unmeasured antiquity, we acknowledge
the honour and the darkness of the human inheritance.
Most impressive of all, because they
recur across many counties, are the names of roads,
like the Sarn Helen of Wales, the Pilgrims’ Way of
England. It is part of their power that they have
no obvious and limited significance, and were certainly
not bestowed by king or minister as names
are given by a merchant to his commodities. Instead
of “London Road” we see “Watling Street”;
instead of “North Road” there is “Foss Way”
or “Ermine Street.” But all these make some
appeal, however fantastical, to the intelligence.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
“Icknield Street” or “Icknield Way” makes no
such appeal. It is the name of two apparently distinct
roads: one with a Roman look running north
and south through Worcestershire and Warwickshire,
the other winding with the chalk hills through
Suffolk, Cambridgeshire, Hertfordshire, Bedfordshire,
Buckinghamshire, Oxfordshire, Berkshire,
and Wiltshire. I shall confine myself as far as
possible to this second road. It runs south-westwards
from East Anglia and along the Chilterns to
the Downs and Wessex; but the name is mysterious.
For centuries&mdash;since Holinshed&mdash;it was supposed to
be connected with the East Anglian kingdom of the
Iceni: only fifty years ago Guest confidently translated
it as the warpath of the Iceni, and connected
it with the names of places along its course, such
as Icklingham, Ickleton, and Ickleford. To-day, it is
pointed out with equal confidence that “according
to philological laws Iceni would have produced in
England a form beginning with Itch- or Etch-.”
Dr. Henry Bradley cannot believe that there was
any knowledge of the Iceni in Berkshire, but finds
it “a natural supposition” that the road was called
after a woman named Icenhild, though he points
out that no such person or name is known in myth
or history.</p>

<p>It is a pleasure to see a learned man of the
twentieth century thus playing at the invention of a
twilight deity as the patroness of an old road, like the
Helen or Elen of Wales. Two hundred years ago
his invention would have been wholly serious and
generations of equally serious and less inventive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
antiquaries would have followed him. There have
been other explanations. Camden, at the same time
as Holinshed, accepted the connection with the
Iceni, but “what the origin of the name should
be,” he says in his <cite>Suffolk</cite>, “as God shall help me,
I dare not guess, unless one should derive it from
the <i>wedgy</i> figure of the county, and refer to its lying
upon the ocean in form of a <i>wedge</i>. For the Britons
in their language call a wedge Iken....” John
Aubrey had it from “Mr. Meredith Lloyd” that
“Ychen is upper, as to say the upper country or
people,” and that “Ychen” also signifies “oxen.”
Wise, in 1738, linked it with the name of Agricola,
because of the significant core of Ick, or in the
form “Ryknield,” rick. Willis, in 1787, said that
the road took its name from the Itchen, believing
that it began at Southampton and went parallel to
that river to Winchester; and that Iken-eld was
the Saxon name for the Old Iken Street. The poet
William Barnes, lover of ancient Britons, said that
it might come from a word meaning high or upper,
either because it was “an upcast way” or because
it was the “upper or eastern road,” while Ryknield
seemed to him to come from a word meaning
a trench, and therefore a “hollow way.” And still
nobody knows or believes that anybody else knows.
The name, therefore, throws no light at present on
the use or history of the road.</p>

<p>Much has been written about the Icknield Way
by antiquaries from the sixteenth to the nineteenth
centuries. Most of them regarded the road as one
of the four royal roads or Roman roads of Britain,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
on the authority not of local evidence and direct
examination, but of half-mythic laws and histories.
The earliest of these are “The Laws of Edward the
Confessor.” Here four roads are mentioned&mdash;Watlinge
strete, Fosse, Hikenilde strete, and
Erminge strete&mdash;two of them extending across
the breadth of the land and two throughout
the length; and travellers on them were
protected by the king’s peace. But Liebermann
assigns as a probable date to these
laws a year between 1130 and 1135: Pollock and
Maitland, in their <cite>History of English Law</cite>, condemn
the work as a compilation of the last years of
Henry I; having something of the nature of a political
pamphlet and being adorned with pious legends,
“its statements, when not supported by other
evidence, will hardly tell us more than that sane
men of the twelfth century would have liked these
statements to be true.” The French version of the
“Laws of William the Conqueror” is almost word
for word the same as the Laws of the Confessor in
the matter of the royal roads: the Latin version
omits Hykenild strete. Roger de Hoveden, in 1200,
uses almost the same words: so does Henry of
Huntingdon in 1130, except that he describes the
Icknield Way as going out of the east into the west.</p>

<p>Mr. Harold Peake suggests to me that these writers
may all have had as their inspiration the brilliant
Geoffrey of Monmouth, who wrote the <cite>History of
the British Kings</cite> in the early twelfth century. He
tells us, in language not more credible than that
of “The Dream of Maxen” in the <cite>Mabinogion</cite>, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
King Belinus commanded four roads to be made
over the length and breadth of the <span class="lock">island:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“Especially careful was he [King Belinus] to
proclaim that the cities and the highways that led
unto the city should have the same peace that
Dunwallo had established therein. But dissension
arose as concerning the highways, for that none
knew the line whereby their boundaries were determined.
The king therefore, being minded to leave
no loophole for quibbles in the law, called together
all the workmen of the whole island, and commanded
a highway to be builded of stone and mortar that
should cut through the entire length of the island
from the Cornish sea to the coast of Caithness, and
should run in a straight line from one city unto
another the whole of the way along. A second also
he bade be made across the width of the kingdom,
which, stretching from the city of Menevia on the
sea of Demetia as far as Hamo’s port, should show
clear guidance to the cities along the line. Two
others also he made to be laid out slantwise athwart
the island so as to afford access unto the other cities.
Then he dedicated them with all honour and dignity,
and proclaimed it as of his common law, that condign
punishment should be inflicted on any that
should do violence to other thereon. But if any would
fain know all of his ordinances as concerning them,
let him read the Molmutine laws that Gildas the
historian did translate out of the British into Latin,
and King Alfred out of the Latin into the English
tongue.”</p>

<p>This great north-and-south road is like Ermine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
Street, the slantwise roads might be Watling Street
and the Foss Way, and that across the width from
Menevia to “Hamo’s port,” the Icknield Way. As
Geoffrey makes one road go from the Cornish sea to
Caithness, so Henry of Huntingdon takes his Fosse
Way from Totnes to Caithness. Henry, as is
known, had read part or all of Geoffrey’s book before
it was given to the world and made an abstract of
it; and the romancer had warned him to be silent
as to the British kings, because he had not that
book in the British tongue, brought from Brittany by
Walter, Archdeacon of Oxford, and translated
into Latin by Geoffrey himself. Here, as usual,
it can safely be said that Geoffrey’s words are not
pure invention; but what his authority in writing or
tradition may have been appears to be undiscoverable.
He may have used some tradition which was
the basis also of the account of the Empress Helen’s
road-making in “The Dream of Maxen.” He may
have used the so-called laws of Dynwal Moel Mud&mdash;“before
the crown of London and the supremacy
of this island were seized by the Saxons”&mdash;who
measured the length and breadth of the island, in
order “to know its journeys by days.” (<cite>Laws and
Institutes of Wales: Vendotian Code.</cite>) Henry
of Huntingdon may well have been a meek adapter
of Geoffrey’s majestic statements, and some local
knowledge of his own may have helped him to put
names upon the roads of Belinus. To this second
road from St. David’s (Menevia) to Hamo’s port or
Southampton he gives the name of Ichenild or Ikenild.
Walter Map, in <cite>De Nugis Curialium</cite> (<i>circa</i> 1188),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
speaks of Canute holding London and the land
beyond Hickenild, and Edmund the rest; the
Anglo-Saxon <cite>Chronicle</cite> says that Edmund had
Wessex and Canute the “north part” or Mercia;
and these two together help to define the road.</p>

<p>Whether Henry of Huntingdon’s history owed
anything to Geoffrey, Robert of Gloucester’s metrical
chronicle (<i>circa</i> 1300) certainly did, for he refers
to Belinus as the road-maker; but, like Henry, he
calls the road from Totnes to Caithness the Fosse.
Of the Icknield Street he says that it went from east
to west, and also, apparently, that it was the road
from St. David’s to Southampton through Worcester,
Cirencester, and Winchester. A writer of <i>circa</i> 1360,
Ralph Higden, mentions Belin, and he gives two
theories about the Fosse, but evidently himself knows
nothing. He calls the east-and-west road from
St. David’s to Southampton Watling Street.
His fourth road goes from south to north, from
St. David’s, by Worcester and Birmingham, Lichfield
and Derby, Chesterfield and York, to Tynemouth;
and its name varies in different manuscripts
from Rikenildstrete to Hikenilstrete. Guest has
pointed out that Higden was following Geoffrey.
In the <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Eulogium Historiarum</cite> (1362) this road goes
from south to north from St. David’s to Tynemouth,
and is called once Belinstrete, and three times
Hykeneldstret or Hikeneldstret. The author does
not mention Ermine Street, but two Belinstretes, the
other going from St. David’s to Southampton.
It is likely that none of these men except Geoffrey
and perhaps Henry could have mapped the roads.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>The one map of the period showing the roads
is such as they might have been expected to make.
It belongs probably to the thirteenth century and
was reproduced by Hearne, from a British Museum
manuscript, in Vol. V of his edition of Leland’s
<cite>Itinerary</cite> (1710). It shows the four roads by means
of lines and a brief description&mdash;his Fosse going in
the approved manner from Totnes to Caithness, the
Ermine Street due north and south, the Watling
Street from south-east to north-west. Ykenild
Street goes straight across from west to east. The
artist’s description of this as of the other roads
is almost word for word from Henry of Huntingdon.
But there are these differences and additions:
the western extremity of the Icknield Way is not
called St. David’s, but Salisbury, which is thus placed
due north of Totnes where St. David’s should be;
the eastern&mdash;or, as he calls it, the southern&mdash;is
St. Edmunds. At the point of intersection with
Watling Street he writes “Dunstaple,” which is
accurate. Thus he is original only in his description
of the Icknield Way. In putting “Meridies” by
St. Edmunds he made a slip due to his drawing
the map with its north end on the right side. It is
impossible to decide the extent of his mistake in
marking Salisbury at the west end of the road.
He may have believed that it went to Salisbury,
but have been afraid to deviate from the received
opinion that it was an east-and-west road; or he
may simply have put Salisbury in mistake for
St. David’s. Giving Bury St. Edmunds as the
eastern termination suggests local knowledge which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
the accurate position of Dunstable confirms. He
may have been a man of the eastern counties who
thought that Salisbury was not only the end of the
road, as travellers told him, but a city in the west.</p>

<p>Holinshed, in his <cite>Chronicles</cite> (1586), mentions Geoffrey
as the authority for the origin of the four great
roads, and, after quoting him, goes on to describe
an “Ikenild or Rikenild” beginning somewhere
in the south and going through Worcester, Birmingham,
and Chesterfield to the mouth of the Tyne.
“I take it,” he says, “to be called the Ikenild,
because it passed through the kingdome of
the Icenes. For albeit that Leland and others following
him doo seeme to place the Icenes in Norffolke
and Suffolke; yet in mine opinion that cannot well
be doone, sith it is manifest by Tacitus that they laie
neere unto the Silures, and (as I gesse) either in
Stafford and Worcester shires, or in both, except my
conjecture doo fail me.” Here it is to be noticed,
first, that he gives Ikenild and Rikenild as alternative
names of one road and, second, that he sees the
resemblance between “Ikenild” and “Iceni.” He
has evidently thought about the matter, but he
shows no trace of local knowledge or curiosity.
Camden (1586) also only mentions the road in his
introduction to the subject of the Iceni; though
he has to speak of many places touched by the road,
he ignores the fact, if he ever knew it. The poet
Drayton, in his <cite>Polyolbion</cite> (1616), substitutes
“Michael’s utmost Mount” for Totnes at the south
end of the Fosse Way, and takes Watling Street
from Dover to “the farth’st of fruitful Anglesey,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
and he writes like a Warwickshire man of the
country where those two roads cross (Song xiii,
II, 311 <i>et seq.</i>; Song xxvi, II, 43 <i>et seq.</i>). In the
“Sixteenth Song” of <cite>Polyolbion</cite> he makes Watling
sing of herself and her “three sister streets”:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">Since us, his kingly ways, Mulmutius first began,</div>
      <div class="verse">From sea again to sea, that through the Island ran.</div>
      <div class="verse">Which that in mind to keep posterity might have,</div>
      <div class="verse">Appointing first our course, this privilege he gave,</div>
      <div class="verse">That no man might arrest, or debtors’ goods might seize</div>
      <div class="verse">In any of us four his military ways.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Having sung of the Fosse, Watling <span class="lock">continues:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">But O, unhappy chance! through time’s disastrous lot,</div>
      <div class="verse">Our other fellow streets lie utterly forgot:</div>
      <div class="verse">As Icning, that set out from Yarmouth in the East,</div>
      <div class="verse">By the Iceni then being generally possest,</div>
      <div class="verse">Was of that people first term’d Icning in her race,</div>

      <div class="verse">Into the dropping South, and bearing then outright,</div>
      <div class="verse">Upon the Solent Sea stopt on the Isle-of-Wight.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>“Rickneld” he takes from St. David’s to Tynemouth.</p>

<p>It is very clear that Drayton had read Geoffrey
or a disciple. The notes to <cite>Polyolbion</cite> reveal the
fact that Selden accepted Molmutius and his laws.
“Take it upon credit of the British story” are his
words. He accepted also King Belin and the making
of the four roads; but having noticed that authorities
vary as to their courses and even their names,
he is content to say, “To endeavour certainty in
them were but to obtrude unwarrantable conjecture,
and abuse time and you.” Evidently he knew
these roads as a whole neither from personal know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>ledge
nor from contemporary report, but only from
books. Had he known anything he would have
betrayed it, for he digresses to tell the little that
he knows of “Stanstreet in Surrey.”</p>

<p>Drayton apparently knew more, though perhaps
all his knowledge was not available for verse. He
is the first to distinguish clearly between the Ricknield
and the Icknield Street. He takes the Icknield
Way from Yarmouth to the Solent; the definite
“Yarmouth,” now for the first time connected
with the road, the use of the variant Icning, the
connection with the Chilterns, the crossing of
Watling Street&mdash;all suggest local knowledge. Here
more than ever it is to be wished that Drayton had
either written his book in prose or had given his
authorities and his actual notes of local lore. He
was a great lover of England and of Wales, and could
have written one of the finest prose books of the
seventeenth century had he put down what he
knew without ramming it into the mould of rhyme.</p>

<p>Of all these men except Drayton and the man
who drew the map, none betrays personal knowledge
of the road. They are all writing of something
either too generally known to need explanation or
of something which they know only from other
writers. All their words together hardly do more
than prove that there was or had formerly been a
road, known as Ricknield or Icknield Street; or at
most that there were or had been three roads bearing
those names&mdash;one from St. David’s east and then
north to Tynemouth; a second running south-westwards
across the east of England from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
Norfolk to Southampton; and a third from
St. David’s to Southampton. The second seems to
owe nothing to Geoffrey, and all the local knowledge,
such as it is, is so far connected with this.</p>

<p>In 1677 appeared a book by one who had not only
heard of the four royal roads, but had met with
what he believed to be one of them. This was
Robert Plot’s <cite>Natural History of Oxfordshire</cite>. He
<span class="lock">says:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“Of the four Basilical, Consular, or Prætorian
ways, or Chemini majores, I have met with but
one that passeth through this County, the discovery
whereof yet I hope may prove acceptable,
because not described before, or its footsteps any
where noted by Sir H. Spelman, Mr. Camden, or
any other Author that I have read or could hear of:
whereat indeed I cannot but very much wonder,
since it is called by its old name at very many places
[Ikenildway] to this very day. Some indeed call
it Icknil, some Acknil, others Hackney, and some
again Hackington, but all intend the very same
way, that stretches it self in this County from
North-east to South-west; coming into it (out of
Bucks) at the Parish of Chinner, and going out
again over the Thames (into Berks) at the Parish
of Goreing. The reason, I suppose, why this way
was not raised, is, because it lies along under the
Chiltern Hills on a firm fast ground, having the
hills themselves as a sufficient direction: which
is all worth notice of it, but that it passes through
no town or village in the County, but only Goreing;
nor does it (as I hear) scarce any where else, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
which reason ’tis much used by stealers of Cattle:
and secondly, that it seems by its pointing to come
from Norfolk and Suffolk, formerly the Kingdom
of the Iceni, from whom most agree (and perhaps
rightly enough) it received its name Icenild or
Ikenild; and to tend the other way westward
perhaps into Devonshire and Cornwall, to the
Land’s End.”</p>

<p>He adds, with some triumph, that Holinshed was
much mistaken, but he suspends his judgment because
he has read in Dugdale’s <cite>Antiquities of
Warwickshire</cite> of an “Ickle-street” in that county.
He prints a map showing the road passing, all on
its right hand as it goes south, the villages of
“Kempton,” Chinner, Oakley, Crowell Kingston,
Aston Rowant, Lewkner, Sherborne, Watlington,
the Britwells, Ewelme, Croamish Gifford, Nuneham,
Warren, Mungewell, the three Stokes, and then
south of Goring Church. He adds that under
“Stokenchurch Hills,” about Lewkner and Aston
Rowant, there are two Icknield ways, an upper
and a lower; and here it may be mentioned that
Hearne’s diary for September 29th, 1722, has the
<span class="lock">entry:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“I went thro’ Ewelm, a &frac14; of a mile from which
is Gouldsheath, and about 2 furlongs east said
Ewelm passeth the <i>lower Hackneyway</i>.”</p>

<p>Plot gives a substance to a name. He proves the
existence of a road bearing the name of Icknield
and variations of it, and having a course along the
Chilterns, like Drayton’s road. He does not exaggerate;
in fact, he thinks it a poor sort of road<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
when compared with the Icknield Street through
Staffordshire, of which he <span class="lock">says:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“I look upon this of Staffordshire as the most
remarkable of the two, and so to be that Iknild
street, which is usually reckoned to be one of the
four basilical or great ways of England, and not
that of Oxfordshire, this being raised all along and
paved at some places, and very signal almost
wherever it goes, whereas that of Oxfordshire is
not so there, whatever it may be in other counties.”</p>

<p>The next evidence is eighteen years later, and
comes from the maps by Robert Morden illustrating
Gibson’s edition of Camden’s <cite>Britannia</cite> (1695). His
map of Hertfordshire suddenly introduces us to a
road called the Icknal or Icnal Way, running west
from Royston&mdash;perhaps even from Barley, three
miles south-east of Royston&mdash;through Baldock,
then more and more south-east, over the Lea to
the north of Luton, through Dunstable, and so,
leaving on its right hand Toternhoe, Edlesborough,
Ivinghoe, and Marsworth, going out of the map
with Wilston on its right. In the map of Buckinghamshire
this road is continued through Wendover,
and passes Princes Risborough and Bledlow. In
the map of Oxfordshire it is called “Icknield Way,”
and follows a line like that in Plot’s map, crossing
“Grime’s Dike,” leaving Ipsden and Woodcot on
its left, reaching the Thames on the south of
Goring Church. The Berkshire map does not show
any road of this or similar name, or any one corresponding
to it. Nor is the road to be found on the
maps of Essex, Cambridgeshire, Suffolk, or Nor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>folk.
The extension of it through Buckinghamshire
and Hertfordshire may well have come
from the local knowledge of Morden or a collaborator.
There must have been abundant information
of the kind used by Plot which escaped antiquaries
who were thinking about a royal road, a
majestic basilical or consular way, running from
St. David’s to Southampton, or farther. John
Aubrey (died 1697), the man to tap this local lore,
had nothing to say of any such road in his own
county of Wiltshire, but he left some rough notes.
He connects “Iceni” with “Ikenild,” and remarks
(on the authority of Wren) that there were three
Itchings on Ikenel Street, including Itching Stoke
in Hampshire, where the Pilgrims’ Way fords the
Itchen. He says also that a Mr. Sherwood told
him of “an Ikenil way from North Yarmouth to
Plymouth; the country people will say, ‘Keep
along the Ikenil Way,’ <i>scilicet</i> the Wallington Hills.”
Wallington is two miles south-east of Baldock and
south of the Icknield Way, and through it ran a
parallel road (mentioned in <cite>Archæological Journal</cite>,
Vol. XXV) from Barley, by Therfield, Strethall,
Sandon, and Wallington to Clothall; but the term
“Wallington Hills” does not exclude the Icnal
Way marked in Morden’s map. The precise <em>North</em>
Yarmouth may also have been accurate, and I
should be inclined to believe that at that day men
sometimes went between Plymouth and North
Yarmouth by a road or chain of roads known
through perhaps a very large part of its course by
some such name as Ikenil Way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>A period of antiquarian conjecture and invention
was now beginning, with exploration often of an
active kind, but usually kept sternly in obedience
to speculation. At the end of the sixth volume of
Hearne’s <cite>Leland</cite> (1710) is an essay supposed to be
by Roger Gale (1672-1744). He has no doubt
about “four great roads,” but regards the story
of Molmutius and Belinus as exploded, and says
that “nobody now questions but that” the Romans
made them. He distinguishes, “as does Mr.
Drayton,” between Icknield and Ricknield, and
complains of the old confusion. The Icknield Way,
“which has its rise and name from the people
called Iceni,” he finds first “with any certainty
near Barley in Herts,” as in Robert Morden’s map;
but he suggests an eastern continuation through
Ickleton, “and so by Gogmagog hills, and over
Newmarket Heath to Ikesworth, not two miles
south from St. Edmundsbury,” and possibly to
Burgh Castle, near Yarmouth. Returning westward,
he describes a course which might have been
taken from Morden’s map, except that in the
neighbourhood of Luton it touches Streatley instead
of Leagrave, and goes to Houghton Regis as well
as to Dunstable. But having reached Buckinghamshire,
he cannot find it “anywhere apparent to the
eye ... except between Princes Risborrow and
Kemble in the Street, where it is still call’d Icknell
Way.” These are words which suggest that the
eye was not his own. In Oxfordshire he leaves
the road to Plot. At Goring and Streatley he does
not know what to do, because his guides&mdash;Henry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
of Huntingdon and Drayton and others&mdash;disagree.
He conjectures a continuation to Southampton,
another through Speen to Salisbury and beyond,
where he has found the name “Aggleton Road,”
locally given to the road near Badbury Castle, the
Roman road from Old Sarum to Dorchester. He
thinks “Aggleton Road” can have no connection
with Ickleton, but he shows no other reason for
believing that his Roman road is the Icknield Way.</p>

<p>In 1724 appeared the <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Itinerarium Curiosum</cite> of
Gale’s friend William Stukeley (1687-1765), <span class="smcap lowercase">M.D.</span>,
<span class="smcap lowercase">F.R.S.</span>, <span class="smcap lowercase">F.R.C.P.</span> Here he describes an exploration of
the Icknield Way. He takes it through Ickleton
and, like Gale, through Streatley, near Luton; he
mentions the lovely prospect from the northern
sides of the Chilterns and a few more place-names.
East of Ickleton, or his newly discovered Roman
camp at Great Chesterford, he speaks of the road
going along the boundary between Essex and
Cambridgeshire “towards Icleworth in Suffolk.”
He thinks the road Roman. Beyond the Thames
he has no uncertainty like Gale. He says straight
out that at Speen “the great Icening-street road
coming from the Thames at Goring ... crosses
the Kennet river”; also that he found it a little
north of Bridport going to Dorchester, and accompanied
it “with no small pleasure.” If he had any
reason for calling any part of this road “the great
Icening Street of the Romans,” it has never been
discovered, nor has anything else confirmed his
view, except that Leland saw two Roman milestones
between Streatley and Aldworth, which have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
been seen since, but never described except in
rumour. William Stukeley, <span class="smcap lowercase">M.D.</span>, <span class="smcap lowercase">F.R.S.</span>, <span class="smcap lowercase">F.R.C.P.</span>,
who read “Oriuna” for “Fortuna” on a coin, and so
invented the belief that one Oriuna was the wife of
Carausius, was soon afterwards unanswerably questioned
and plainly contradicted on matters of fact
by Smart Lethieullier (1701-60) and Richard Willis.
He is chiefly memorable here because the now
venerable title of <i>Via Iceniana</i> was conferred by
him on the road which he chose to believe the
Icknield Way. The title, translated back into
Icknield Street, is still generally accepted.</p>

<p>Francis Wise (1697-1767) found the road where
Gale had lost it, beyond the ford at Streatley. In
his book on <cite>Some Antiquities in Berkshire</cite> he says
that it loses its name at Streatley, but is “visible
enough” to Blewbury and known as the Great
Reading Road. From Blewbury through Upton
and Harwell this road is called the Portway,
yet he thinks that it may be the Icknield Way
notwithstanding; or, if not, there is an alternative to
the south, lost in the ploughland until near Lockinge
it becomes a raised way called “Icleton Meer”;
while after Wantage it is the “Ickleton Way,” going
“all under the hills between them and Childrey,”
Sparsholt, Uffington, so under White-horse-hill,
leaving Woolston and Compton on the right, thence
to Ashbury and Bishopstone. He thought
that it was making rather for Avebury than
for Salisbury. This road is marked as Eccleton
Street in Roque’s fine eighteenth-century map of
Berkshire, though it is not easy to be certain of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
road indicated by the name, except that it runs at
the foot of the hills.</p>

<p>Richard Willis, in an essay posthumously published
in <cite>Archæologia</cite>, VIII (1787), claims to be the
discoverer of two Roman roads which “fortunately”
crossed one another near his house at Andover.
One of these was the road from Southampton by
Winchester and Cirencester to Gloucester, and this
was, he says, “I doubt not the Ikeneld Street.”
He does not say why he is certain, but his authority
or inspiration was probably Geoffrey or a disciple.
He had an eye for old roads, but too generally
honoured them with the name of Roman. He
noticed the old road leaving his supposed Icknield
Street on the right a mile south of Ogbourne St.
George, and going north-east to the inn now
called “The Shepherd’s Rest” at Totterdown,
which is on the Roman road from Speen to
Cirencester. Among several roads connecting
this Roman “Icknield Street” with the Ermine
Street he mentions a road which he calls a
causeway, from Royston to Ogbourne St. George,
or at least to Bishopston and Wanborough. This
has been called Icknield Street, but he will call it
the “Oxford Icknield Street,” which, he says, from
coinciding with his real Icknield Street at Wanborough,
acquired its name. It would be as reasonable
to say that London took its name from the
London County Council, or that Julius Cæsar took
his from Julius Cæsar Scaliger. The unquestionable
fact&mdash;known to him from Morden’s map, from
Plot, and from Wise&mdash;that there is a road with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
name of Icknield Way, or a variant of it, between
Royston and Wanborough, he regards as a “stumbling
block,” because it stands in the way of theorists
less insolent than himself.</p>

<p>Lysons’ <cite>Magna Britannia</cite> (1806) brings together
two more such opposites as Wise and Willis. In
“Berkshire” a letter is quoted from a Mr. Church,
surveyor of Wantage, describing the Berkshire road,
where Wise had been uncertain, in its eastern half.
Mr. Church <span class="lock">writes:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“The Ickleton-way has been ploughed up across
Wantage East Field till it enters Charlton (a hamlet
of Wantage); it then passes through West Lockinge.
It is lost across Mr. Bastard’s park in East Lockinge,
but appears again from that park to Ginge
Brook, in Ardington parish. It passes by White’s
barn in Sparsholt-court manor, and is afterwards
ploughed up for some way, but appears again,
after crossing the Newbury-way, by Wiltshire’s
and Halve-hill barns, in East Hendred parish;
from thence through the parishes of Harwell, West
Hagbourne, and the hamlet of Upton, to the village
of Blewbury, and through the parishes of Aston
Tirrold, and Cholsey, to Moulsford on the Thames,
and thence to Streatley; from Upton to Streatley
it forms part of the new turnpike road from Wantage
to Reading.” From Upton station to the east
edge of Lockinge Park this road is now an almost continuous
series of cart-tracks known&mdash;at least, in the
neighbourhood of East Hendred, which it leaves
half a mile to the north&mdash;as Ickleton Street
or Ickleton Meer. This evidence of 1911,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
confirming statements made a hundred and
two hundred years ago, is sufficient to identify
that portion of the road as Ickleton
Street. Beyond Wantage, Wise’s description can be
applied only to the modern road from Wantage to
Bishopston, or as far as the “Calley Arms” at
Wanborough. East of Upton the modern road to
Streatley&mdash;the old Reading turnpike&mdash;has a rival in
a series of cart-tracks through Blewbury and the
Astons, and possibly to be connected with the
“Papist Way” near Cholsey.</p>

<p>Thus there is traditional authority for giving the
name of Ickleton Street or Way to a series of roads
in Berkshire between Bishopston and Streatley, and
the name of Icknield or Icnal Way to a road leading
from Royston to Goring; and hence a probability
that the two were united by the ford between Streatley
and Goring. To this can be added a strong impression
that this road came from a Norfolk port
and went westward to Avebury, and thence or by
another route into Devon or Cornwall; but not
one writer, except perhaps Aubrey’s friend, proves
or even implies a contemporary use of this road
throughout its course; while Drayton and Plot
suggest that it had fallen into decay in their
time.</p>

<p>Along with “Mr. Church, surveyor of Wantage,”
in Lysons’ <cite>Berkshire</cite>, appeared a bishop, John
Bennet (1746-1820), Bishop of Cloyne from 1794
until his death. Without any argument or evidence
he makes the following pronouncement, heralded
by the editorial opinion that “his researches have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
enabled him to speak with certainty on the subject”:&mdash;</p>

<p>“The Ikeneld enters Berkshire from Oxfordshire
at Streatley, where it seems to have divided: one
branch by the name of the Ridgeway continued on
the edge of the high ground by Cuckhamsley and
White-horse-hill into Wiltshire; pointing, as Mr.
Wise observes, rather to Avebury or the Devizes
than Salisbury; while the other branch went from
Streatley, perhaps by Hampstead and Hermitage,
under the name of the West Ridge, to Newbury,
and thence it may be to Old Sarum.”</p>

<p>At first he seems to misunderstand Wise, and to
suppose that his Ickleton Street was a road on the
unpopulated ridge and not in the valley past a
string of villages, and he goes on afterwards to assert
that this valley road is Roman and seems to come
from a spot near or rather below Wallingford. In
1806 the Rev. Henry Beeke (<cite>Archæologia, XV</cite>)
expressed the opinion that the Icknield Way crossed
the Thames at Moulsford. As Bennet gives no
reason he makes no apology. His reason for giving
the name of West Ridge to a road running <em>east</em> of
its fellow must have been that it went through the
village of Westridge, where doubtless the road was
called the Westridge Way, as the road from Chevington
is called the Chevington Way, and so on.
He had apparently no reason for choosing the
Ridgeway except that it came from the same ford
at Streatley reached by the Icknield Way at Goring.
Nevertheless, he has been so persistently followed
that the Ridgeway is now given by the Ordnance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
Survey the alternative title of “Icknield Way,”
and also of “Roman Road,” which even the bishop
said it was not; some Berkshire people even call
the Ridgeway the Icknield Way because it is the
“Government name”; and “West Ridge Way”
is attached with all the honour of Old English
lettering to the more easterly road. Bennet equals
Stukeley in the grandeur of his fiction and the
veneration which it has earned. In Lysons’ <cite>Cambridgeshire</cite>
(1808) he takes the road through Newmarket,
herein coinciding with later-proved facts,
but continues it to Ickleton on the east of the
modern turnpike along a course never yet identified.</p>

<p>Men who were not bishops now begin to exercise
themselves in suggesting roads which may have
been continuations of this Ickleton or Icknield Way.
They print their opinions with varying degrees of
certainty. In 1829 Dr. Mason, rector of Orford,
in Suffolk (<cite>Archæologia</cite>, XXIII), traces it, “after
it leaves Ixworth,” to Buckenham and thence by
two forks to Caistor and to Burgh Castle. Samuel
Woodward, in 1830 (<cite>Archæologia</cite>, XXIII), also
assumes that it passes through Buckenham, Ixworth,
and Bury St. Edmunds. In 1833 Alfred John Kempe
(<cite>Archæologia</cite>, XXVI) takes it for granted that the
road “crossed the kingdom from Norwich towards
Old Sarum.” With an “I need hardly observe,”
he connects the road with the Iceni, and explains
it as “the Iken-eld-strete, that is, the old street or
way of the Iceni.” Arthur Taylor (<cite>Archæological
Institute: Memoirs</cite>, 1847; Norwich volume) connects
the road with Norwich Castle Hill, which he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
believes to be British. Like the Ordnance Survey
map, he takes it through Newmarket, Kentford,
Cavenham, Lackford, and Thetford. Like Bennet,
both Woodward and Taylor regard the road as a
British trackway. But Taylor earns his chief distinction
by the possession of a deed “apparently of
the reign of Henry iii,” relating to premises at
Newmarket and “extending upon Ykenildweie.”</p>

<p>In 1856, in the form of a discourse afterwards
embodied in his <cite>Origines Celticæ</cite> (1883), Edwin Guest
wrote a long account of the Icknield Way. He
mentions as evidence charters of the tenth century
referring to estates in Berkshire between Blewbury
and Wayland’s Smithy, so minute, he says, as almost
to be sufficient foundation for a map, but not to
enable him to trace the road; for he accepts
Bennet’s substitution of the Ridgeway. North of
the Thames his earliest evidence is a parchment,
possibly of the fourteenth century, relating to the
foundation of Dunstable Priory at a place where
the two royal roads of Watling and Ickneld cross,
a place of woods and robbers near Houghton. He
quotes a “letter testimonial of 1476” proving
that this trackway, west of Dunstable, was known
as Ikeneld Strete. He takes the road from Icklingham
and through Ickleton and Ickleford because
that is a possible course and because he believes
those names to be connected with “Iceni” and
“Icknield.” What was the one great road described
as Icknield Street in the <cite>Laws of the Confessor</cite> he
finds it hard to define. But he can find no traces
of Roman construction in the road. Inspired by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
the map showing Salisbury at the end of the road,
he suggests that “most probably” it joined the
Ridgeway east of Avebury and continued along its
course, as recently described by Sir Richard Colt
Hoare.</p>

<p>Messrs. Woodward and Wilks, in their history of
Hampshire (1861-9), are well acquainted with the
many theories of the road, and “on the whole see
most reason” for agreeing with Drayton, but also for
giving the name to the Roman road from Winchester
to Cirencester and Gloucester, or another Roman
road running north-west of Basingstoke. They
speak of the allegation that in ancient deeds the
road to Gloucester is designated as Hicknel or
Hicknal Way; but these have not been identified.</p>

<p>C. C. Babington, in his <cite>Ancient Cambridgeshire</cite>
(1883), speaks of the road as easily traced from
Thetford to Kentford, and he regards Woodward’s
British way from Norwich by Wymondham and
Attleborough to Thetford as a continuation. But
he has no documentary evidence, no tradition, and
no local name to support his conjectures at any
point between Norwich and Royston, except at
Newmarket. He could not find Bennet’s road from
Newmarket east of the turnpike. Probably the
bishop meant the roads west of Westley Waterless,
past Linnet Hall, west of Weston Colville, West
Wratting and Balsham; it is improbable that he
did more than fly over them in fancy. He is
satisfied that where the parish, and afterwards
the county, boundaries coincide with the present
road from Newmarket it is the Icknield Way,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
especially as at Stump Cross the county boundary
follows the sudden turn out of the main road along
a little-used lane leading over the Cam to Ickleton.
From Ickleton to a point near Chrishall Grange and
a tumulus&mdash;where for a mile the lane is a county
boundary&mdash;it is uncertain; but from that point to
Noon’s Folly he is content with the “nearly disused
track,” which near there again becomes a
county boundary. Thus he connects Newmarket and
Royston by a road of the same character as the
well-warranted parts of the Icknield Way without
any evidence but probability.</p>

<p>The Rev. A. C. Yorke (<cite>Proceedings of the Cambridge
Antiquarian Society</cite>, 1903) prefers the road
known as Ashwell Street, which runs for some miles
nearly parallel with the supposed Icknield Way
and is most clear from Ashwell, north of Baldock,
to Melbourn, north-east of Royston. In a lucid
and vigorous article he says that “there can be
no doubt” that “Ashwell Street is the original
Icknield Way.” He is willing to give up the name
of one road, take away the name from another
road which has borne it since 1695, and in one
place since Henry the Third, and give it to the
first which has never borne it, so far as he knows.
He thinks the so-called Icknield Way from Newmarket
to Hitchin, Roman; just as others think
his Ashwell Street Roman, Mr. F. Codrington, e.g.,
holding that Ashwell Street was an alternative
course, leaving the Icknield Way at Worsted Lodge
and returning at Wilbury Camp.</p>

<cite>Knowledge</cite>, II, 99) attempts to connect Newmarket
with Norwich and call the road the Icknield Way.
He suggests a route over the Kennett at Kentford
and the Lark at Lackford; then to Icklingham All
Saints, and following the boundary of the hundreds
of Blackbourn and Lackford to Thetford, having
crossed the road from Newmarket to Thetford at
Marmansgrave, and that between Bury and Thetford
a few yards north of Thetford Gasworks, where
the remains of a British settlement were found in
1870. He crosses the Little Ouse and Thet where
the Nuns’ Bridges now are. On the other side “the
logical and undoubtedly correct continuation of the
Icknield Way” is by Castle Lane and Green Lane.
A find of Celtic and Roman pottery at the south<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
end of Green Lane, old thorns in the fields between
Green Lane and Roudham Heath, old banks on the
heath near Peddars’ Way, “which it crosses about
half a mile from where Peddars’ Way is joined by
the Drove,” a “Bridgham tradition” of a waggon
road over Roudham Heath, and the battle of
Ringmore, fought there between Sweyn and Ulfketel,
the find of bronze weapons and flint axes at Attleborough,
and the supposed British origin of Norwich
Castle Hill, take him by these places. From Norwich
he goes by Sprowston, Rackheath, Wroxham,
Hoveton, Beeston, over the Ant by the “Devil’s
Ditch,” or “Roman Camp,” at Wayford to Stalham
and to Happisburgh. Except that Stalham is
near Hickling, this route has nothing&mdash;no local
map, no documents&mdash;to entitle it to be called the
Icknield Way.</p>

<p>Mr. Beloe (Cambridge Antiquarian Society, <cite>Proceedings</cite>,
VII) suggests an easterly line beyond
Newmarket by a supposed junction with the Ailesway
from Newmarket, by Brandon Ferry and
Narford to Hunstanton.</p>

<p>Mr. J. C. Tingey (<cite>Norfolk Archæology</cite>, XIV) agrees
that such a junction may have been used, but prefers
a line through Ickburgh and Cockley Cley, crossing
the Wissey at Mundford. He also proposes another
route from Lackford almost to Thetford, which he
avoids, crossing the Ouse on to Snarehill, with its
many tumuli, because he thinks an early traveller
would have done this. Then, with no trace of a
road, he goes over Snare Hill to Shadwell Park, the
Harlings, Uphall, Kenninghall to Banham, where a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
street was once called Tycknald Street (Blomefield’s
<cite>History of Norfolk</cite>); or he could reach Banham
from Elvedon, Barnham, and Rushford. After
Banham he leaves a gap of twelve miles, hastening
to Swainsthorpe, south-east of Norwich, where he
has found a Hickling Lane, called “Icklinge Way,”
in a seventeenth-century conveyance, where it is
said to lead to Kenninghall. He has also found in
Blomefield a mention of “the way called Ykeneldsgate,”
in that parish, dated 1308.</p>

<p>The partly lost line of this lane he has made out
through Mulbarton; beyond which he is struck
by the place-names of Keningham, Kentlow, and
Kenninghall, noticing the other similar names on or
near the supposed Icknield Way&mdash;Kentford, Kennet,
Kensworth (once “Ikensworth”), Kennett, in
Wiltshire, and, beyond Exeter, Kenn and Kenn
Ford. Other documents of 1482 and 1658 relating
to the next parish to Swainsthorpe, Stoke Holy
Cross, enable him to extend the road with some
probability eastward. They also show that the
road was known at about the same time as Hickley
Lane in one parish, and Stoke Long Lane in another.
Most remarkable of all, he has found in Blomefield
mention of “the way called Ykeneldsgate” in the
same parish of Stoke Holy Cross, in 1306. He
suggests reaching Haddiscoe as his “port in Celtic
times,” by Framingham Earl, Bergh Apton, Thurton
Church, Loddon, and Raveningham. He sternly
avoids Norwich as post-Roman, and Bury for the
same reason. At the same time he admits the probability
of branches to those places when they became<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
important. Thus he shows that he has in his mind
one road, with one name, and that something like
Icknield Street, going from sea to sea, not only in
the Confessor’s time, but before the Romans.</p>

<p>It is impossible even to outline the multitudinous
conjectures at the north-east end of the Icknield
Way. At the south-west conjecture has been all
but silenced by Stukeley’s invention of the Via
Iceniana and Bennet’s substitution of the Ridgeway,
both stupefying fictions.</p>

<p>For two hundred years these conjectures have
been multiplied and become venerable by repetition.
Plot thinks that the road might go from Norfolk
to Devon and Land’s End. Gale fancies Caistor and
Burgh Castle at one end, and, as Stukeley did, Exeter
at the other. Dr. Beeke “supposes” it went from
Streatley towards Silchester, also that it crossed
the Thames at Moulsford. Colt Hoare speaks of it
as connecting Old Sarum with Dorchester and
Winchester. Arthur Taylor takes it for granted
that it came from “Cornwall or some extreme
point in the south-west of Britain” to Norwich and
Hickling. Isaac Taylor says that it went from
Norwich to Dorchester and Exeter. Mr. H. M.
Scarth conjectures that the road crossing the main
street of Silchester, which runs east and west, may
have been an extension of the Icknield Way from
Wallingford to Winchester. In <cite>Social England</cite> Col.
Cooper King, following Stukeley, takes the road to
Exeter, Totnes, and Land’s End; following Bennet,
he takes it along the Ridgeway. Elton calls it
briefly a road from Norwich through Dunstable and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
Silchester to Southampton, and to Sarum and the
western districts.</p>

<p>The theorists and conjecturers have done little
to ascertain the course of a road which can safely
be called the Icknield Way. By far the greater part
of the work has been done by men who used chiefly
local tradition. Plot in Oxfordshire, Wise in Berkshire,
perhaps Robert Morden or an unknown
assistant in Hertfordshire. The best of the conjecturers
have only linked up the authenticated
parts in a probable manner. Most have been too
busy with their own views to be anything but
benevolent to others. But in 1901 appeared one
with no theory and without benevolence, Professor
F. Haverfield. In a chapter on “Romano-British
Norfolk,” in the <cite>Victoria County History</cite> of that
county, he pronounces that the Icknield Way is not
a Roman road; that it has nothing to do with the
Iceni or Norfolk or Suffolk; that the name Icknield
and the names like Ickleton and Kenninghall of places
on the road, or supposed parts of it, cannot, for
philological reasons, be connected with the Iceni.
At present he is unanswerable, though his mind is
of a type which commands more interest when it
affirms than when it denies.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 550px;">

</a>
<div class="caption"><p>Icknield Way, near Ipsden, Oxfordshire.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Since the time of Wise little has been done
except to add proofs of the antiquity of the
road under the Chilterns and the Berkshire
Downs. In his day it was known from Royston
to Bishopston. Taylor showed that it touched
Newmarket, but no more. Mr. Tingey shows that
it went through Stoke Holy Cross in Norfolk,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
but little or nothing has been done to fill the gap
between his fragment of Hickling Lane and Newmarket.
Even the road between Newmarket and
Royston depends for its title only on its respectability
as a county and parish boundary. Reaching
the Thames there is no certainty of the principal
ford; but Streatley must have been one, and from
there to Bishopston the main line of the road is clear
enough. A man may follow the whole of this road
in a few days, and be upon a beaten track if not
a hard road everywhere, except for a few hundred
yards near Ipsden, and two or three miles from
the east side of Lockinge Park. The two lengths
north and south of the Thames make a road of
uniform character, keeping almost entirely to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
the chalk, but below the steepest wall of the hills.
From Dunstable westward this wall on the left
or south of the road is an unmistakable guide to
the traveller; as far as Swyncombe he has only to
cling to the foot of the wall and he is on the Icknield
Way. Beyond the Thames the Downs make a
guiding wall equally clear and continuous. It
belongs to what Mr. Harold Peake, in his “Prehistoric
Roads of Leicestershire” (<cite>Memorials of Old Leicestershire</cite>),
calls the “hill-side” type of road, which
“winds along the sides of hills just above the alluvium.
Marshes and low-lying ground are avoided,
but small streams do not offer so great an obstacle
as in the case of the ridge-roads.” He compares
it with the Pilgrims’ Way from Winchester to
Canterbury, which it closely resembles, except
that it keeps always on the northern slopes, instead
of the southern, and commands throughout its
course views of a wide, fertile valley northward.</p>

<p>Until the enclosures and the metalling of roads
the ruts and hoof-marks of the Icknield Way were
probably spread over a width of from a hundred
yards to a mile, according to convenience or necessity;
from century to century its course might
vary even more. Thus the modern road between
Kentford and Newmarket is at several points some
distance from the Cambridge and Suffolk boundary,
which is supposed to follow the Icknield Way.</p>

<p>A deed already mentioned proves that the road
was known in Newmarket itself.</p>

<p>Beyond Newmarket the modern road is marked
as the Icknield Way, but is only a parish boundary,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
or rather close to one, for one mile in the first eight,
and is not authenticated by any known documents.
Nor is any parallel road in the same direction a
boundary line. That it is on an old line of road is
certain from the number of tumuli which formerly
dotted the surrounding heath. It goes through
three dykes, two, eight, and thirteen miles from
Newmarket, and it has been conjectured both
that the dykes defend the road and that the road
was made by an invader to pierce the dykes; one
antiquary asserts that the fosse of the Brent Ditch
“has evidently been filled up to admit the road.”
From a little beyond the eighth milestone and
Fleam Dyke the road is a parish boundary, with
very short interruptions between the eleventh and
twelfth, as far as the fourteenth, where it becomes
the Cambridge and Essex boundary. Turning
west beyond the fifteenth, it is followed for some
distance by the county boundary, and is thrice
rejoined by it, the third time for two miles before
entering Royston. By this sharp turning to the
west it avoids a Roman camp at Great Chesterford,
and passes what Camden called the “ancient
little city” of Ickleton, where in his time traces
of the “Burrough banks” could plainly be seen.
Near Abbey Farm at Ickleton are the remains of
a priory. Where it is again a county boundary
beyond Ickleton, near “a tumulus opened by the
late Lord Braybrooke,” it is a farm road, and
continues as such in a clear line through arable
land and alongside hedges, until it joins the main
road into Royston. Here it goes over Burloes Hill,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
where many indications of ancient burials have
been found.</p>

<p>From Royston onwards, as has been seen, the
road is marked in a map of 1695. It is mentioned,
says Beldam (<cite>Archæological Journal</cite>, XXV),
in documents of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries
among the monuments of Royston Priory,
as “Hickneld” and “Ykenilde.” There are hut-circles
on the heath to the west, associated with
neolithic implements. At Royston, as at Baldock
and Tring, gold coins of Cunobelin have been found;
and here the road crosses Ermine Street. West
of Royston the road is again a county boundary,
and goes for miles between many tumuli. “A
small Roman habitation” was opened at Slip End
near Odsey by Lord Braybrooke. At “Slip Inn”
it bounds parishes instead of counties. There is a
manor-house and moat at Bygrave, and a tumulus
on Metley Hill opposite. Here it passes between
two unenclosed parishes, Bygrave and Clothall.
It goes along the edge of Baldock, where they
have found neolithic and Bronze Age implements
and coins of Cunobelin and of “Icenian type,”
and Roman urns: here is the crossing of Stane
Street from Godmanchester to Colchester. For
five miles beyond Baldock the road is a parish
boundary. It touches a camp at Wilbury Hill,
and near it they have found “a great variety
of coins of the Roman emperors” and a small
copper blade, coins of Constantine, bones and
ashes. Ickleford, where it ceases to be a boundary,
has produced palæolithic evidences, and the neigh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>bourhood
of Hitchin, a mile south, palæolithic and
neolithic and late Celtic. Two miles farther on
it is a parish boundary for a mile and a half, and
then the Hertford and Bedford boundary to the
top of Telegraph Hill. Ravenspurgh Castle is a
mile north of it on the Barton Hills. It turns along
Dray’s Ditches and enters the road from Barton
to Luton. Here the parish boundary goes straight
across, following a lane, to Great Bramingham Farm
and, with a break, to Chalton, from which the road
might have gone through to Houghton Regis
and “the British town of Maiden Bower,”
and to the north of Dunstable. But the
line of the road is continued from Dray’s
Ditches across the Luton road to Limbury, and
over the Lea at Leagrave Marsh, passing, near the
moats and the remains of a nunnery at Limbury, the
fortification of Waulud’s Bank, and the scene of
many finds of coins and neolithic implements.
This line is clear on Morden’s seventeenth-century
map. A new street called “Icknield Way” and a
footpath lead with recent interruptions into the
Luton and Dunstable road, which is for some time
a parish boundary. Here it begins to follow under
the Downs, which have traces of Celtic huts.</p>

II, III) there are various references to
tenements in the west field or west street
extending upon Ikenild-strete, viz. between
the time of Edward III and Henry VI. West
of Dunstable the direction but not the course
of the road is proven by a “letter testimonial” of
1476, where a cross is mentioned standing “in the
field of Toternho, the which cross standeth in
Ikeneld Stret, to the which cross the way leading
from Spilmannstroste directly stretcheth and extendeth,
at which place there hath been a cross
standing from time that no mind is.” Toternhoe
parish now includes three-quarters of a mile of
the supposed Icknield Way, from the inn at the
turning to Kensworth Common, as far as Well
Head, and between these points the cross may have
stood. Round about the road here are many
tumuli on the open downs, and traces of Celtic
huts. Toternhoe has a camp not a mile from Maiden
Bower, which is in Houghton Regis. A chalk pit
three-quarters of a mile north-east of the “Plough”
yielded Roman coins in 1769. The “Ykenyldewey”
is mentioned in the description of a piece of land
at Edlesborough, south-west of Dunstable, in
1348 (Close Rolls, Edward III); and the “Ikenyldstret”
at Eaton Bray, close by, in the time
of Edward II and Richard II (<cite>Catalogue of Ancient
Deeds</cite>, I, II, III). The villages of Edlesborough and
Eaton Bray are visible a little north of the road.
Passing under Beacon Hill and its tumulus, the road
enters one from Leighton Buzzard to Aldbury and
Wigginton, and out of this road, at points a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
north and a little south of the entrance, run two
roads marked as the “Lower” and “Upper”
Icknield Way, keeping more or less parallel courses
as far as Lewknor, where the lower is supposed
to join the upper. Neither is a parish or county
boundary. At Aston Clinton the “Lower” is
crossed and deflected by Akeman Street, which
it enters for a mile in a north-westerly direction.
Aston has yielded late Celtic pottery. At Weston
Turville the “Lower” passes, near the manor-house,
a place where a Roman amphora was found in 1855.
Akeman Street and several other roads cross and
deflect the “Upper” Way. After traversing Wendover
you have a camp and barrow on Balcombe
Hill, a little to the south. A Danish entrenchment
comes down to it from Swyncombe Downs near
Britwell. It crosses Grim’s Ditch at Foxberry
Wood. Flint implements have been found along
its course, e.g. in Pulpit Wood at Great Kimble, and
at Bledlow. At Whiteleaf, above Monks Risborough,
and also above Bledlow, men have carved the turf
into crosses, which may be modifications of much
earlier phallic forms. British coins, inscribed and
uninscribed, have been found at Wendover and
Ellesborough, Roman coins between Ipsden and Glebe
Farm. Only beyond, where the upper and lower roads
are supposed to have united, does the track coincide
with a parish boundary, and that but seldom and
only for short distances. In Buckinghamshire it
was known in the year 903, and mentioned in a
“record by King Eadweard, at the request of
Duke Aethelfrid, who had lost the original deed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
by fire, of a grant by Athulf to his daughter Aethelgyth
of land at East Hrisan Byrg, or Princes
Risborough” (<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cartularium Saxonicum</cite>, No. 603). It
is there called “the Icenhylte,” and the boundary
of the land in question runs along it as far as “the
heathen burials.” Through Oxfordshire, from
Chinnor to Goring and the Streatley ford, the road
is authenticated by Plot’s map; but routes to
the other fords are at present conjectural. Streatley
meant the longest way round for travellers going
west through Berkshire, but it offered the driest
approaches on both hands and the narrowest
possible strip of wet land at the crossing. In
summer at least Wallingford would attract westward
travellers; and there is a thirteenth-century
reference in the <cite>Abingdon Chronicle</cite> to Ikeneldstrete
as running from Wallingford to Ashbury. Men
using this ford would have turned out of the Streatley
track at Gypsies’ Corner; and here, or a mile
or two beyond, near Ipsden, they could branch to
Moulsford and the Stokes.</p>

<p>Beyond Streatley there is at first only one road
westward on the dry and rising land. This is the
main road between Reading and Wantage, with a
fork to Wallingford. Mr. Church, of Wantage
(1806), pronounced this road to be the Ickleton
Way as far as Upton, and his word may be taken
to prove at least that this was the local name.
For anyone crossing at Streatley and going west
under the hills, instead of along the ridge, there is
no other road; and even from Moulsford and
Wallingford men would be forced, by the river on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
one side and bad ground on the other, to enter this
road at Upton, if not at Blewbury, or before.
The ford at Streatley is said to be Roman. Roman
pottery has been found in the river, and coins on
the south bank. Roman coins by the hundred,
dating from 43 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> to <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 383, have been ploughed
up in the neighbourhood. “Near Aston” coins,
<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 267-74, have been found. They have dug up
Roman things in Blewbury Fields, on Hagbourne
hill, at Hendred, on Charlton Downs, at Wantage,
at Letcombe Regis, in the Dragon Hill near the
White Horse, at Woolston, and at Ashbury. Implements
of the Bronze Age have been recorded at
Cholsey, Moulsford, Blewbury, Hagbourne Hill,
Wantage, Letcombe Bassett. Wallingford has yielded
palæolithic, neolithic, Bronze Age, and later evidences.</p>

<p>These things, and more that could be mentioned,
suggest ancient settlements and communications
below the downs. Ickleton Street would seem
likely to have been the main line of travel here,
and a series of Saxon charters prove that such it
was.</p>

<p>A grant of land by Edmund to Ælfric, and by
him to Abingdon, shows that an Ichenilde Wege
went through Blewbury in 944, and that the
Ridgeway was distinct and at some distance from it;
a grant in 903 by Eadweard to Tata the son of
Æthelhun and by him to Abingdon, one by Edgar
to Ælfric and by him to Winchester in 973, and
one by Edgar to Ælfstan and by him to Winchester
in 970, show it at Harwell (Kemble,
<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Codex

Diplomaticus</cite>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span> Nos. 1080, 578, 1273). In the grant
of 903 the boundary starts at a brook, the Swyn
Brook, and goes along the Harwell Way to the
Icenhilde Wey, then up the old wood-way by
the east of Harwell Camp to a warren, and so up
to the stone on the Ridgeway, then on and back to
the Ridgeway, and down on the other side of Harwell
Camp to the Icenhilde Wey, farther down
to a spring and an elder bed, evidently in the
low land. This shows that the Icknield Way was
a road running between the Ridgeway and the
lowest land. A grant of land made in 955 by
Eadred to Ælfheh and by him to Abingdon at
Compton Beauchamp (Kemble, No. 1172) proves
the same. The boundary starts at the Ridgeway,
and goes to the Icenhilde Wey, and on to the
Swyn Brook, and back again past a barrow to the
Icenhilde Wey, and up to the Ridgeway, and over
hills, slades, and a green way back to Wayland’s
Smithy. A grant of Æthelstan to Abingdon, of
land in Woolston, Compton, and Ashbury (Kemble,
No. 1129), and another (No. 1168) mention as
landmarks Ikenilde Strete, then what is probably
Uffington Castle, and other places on the downs;
then what is probably Ælfred’s Castle and two
barrows and the Ikenilde Strete again, and finally
a rush bed in the low land. A grant by Æthelwulf
to Winchester and Bishop Stigand in 854 of lands
at Wanborough (Kemble, No. 1053) describes
a boundary passing downs and coombes to the
source of the Hlyd (there is a Lyde spring at Ashbury),
along the stream to a ditch, past the Dorc<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
stream, the Smit stream, and a black pit, over the
Icknield Way at or near some heathen burial place,
and so to down country with a white pit, two
stones, and a coombe, etc.&mdash;and from a study of
the district Mr. Harold Peake concludes that “the
Icknield Way crossed the parish very near the
modern road which on the Ordnance Map bears
this name, though I fancy it ran originally a few
hundred yards to the north.” It is clear, then, that
the Icknield Way ran as far as Wanborough between
the highest and lowest ground along a course
similar to that of Wise’s Ickleton Street. The
road mentioned must either be Wise’s road or
another of similar course which has been superseded
by it in name and use, and can hardly be
other than that now called on the Ordnance Map
the Port Way.</p>

<p>Thus the road from Newmarket&mdash;or at least
from Royston&mdash;by Streatley to Wanborough parish
is a venerable and continuous one, which bore
almost the same name at its extremities&mdash;Ykenildeweie
at Newmarket in the time of Henry III,
Icenhilde Weg at Wanborough in 854. That it is
Icknield Street, one of the “four royal roads,”
is proved only by its coming out of the east and
going westward, and by its crossing Watling Street
at Dunstable, as does the Ykenildstrete of the
thirteenth-century map. Unlike the other three
roads, the Icknield Way appears not to have been
Romanized at any point, and, assuming that it
had in the Middle Ages the importance suggested
by its rank with these roads, its primitive character<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
would explain its decay. Nothing rescued it as
pilgrimages rescued that part of an ancient east-and-west
road now known as the Pilgrims’ Way
from Winchester to Canterbury (<cite>The Old Road</cite>, by
Hilaire Belloc). Its western object had apparently
been so deeply lost in Drayton’s time that the
poet took it to Southampton, though whether this
line is to be traced to Geoffrey of Monmouth’s
bold definition or to contemporary usage cannot
easily be decided. That this road through Newmarket
and Streatley is the one in Drayton’s
mind is certain.</p>

<p>Of the other roads called Icknield Street, most,
if not all, of them difficult, where not impossible,
to connect with this road as continuations or as
branches, one is particularly interesting here.</p>

<p>Dr. Macray’s “MS. Catalogue of Magdalen College
Deeds” contains several mentions of Ikenildwey or
Hykenyldewey in descriptions of boundaries at
Enham, near Andover, in Hampshire. One belonging
to 1270 refers to land “in the east field of
Enham, on the north of the highway called Ikenildwey”;
another of 1317 to two acres of land in Enham
Regis in a field called Bakeleresbury; “of the which
one acre lies between the land of Gilbert Slyk on
either side, extending south to Ikenildwe ...”;
one of 1337 to arable land in the fields of Andover,
of which half an acre extends “above Hykenyldewey
to the east,” between other estates in the north
and south, while another acre in the same field
extends “above Laddrewey to the north.” I
conclude from these descriptions that the Hykenyldewey<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
here ran east and west, and it is not a region
of winding roads. Batchelor’s Barn and Walworth
cottages, about a mile east of Andover, seem to
contain memories of “La Werthe,” “La Walwert,”
and “Bakeleresbury.” Both the barn and the
cottages lie close to the south side of the Harrow
Way, which here goes east and west on its way from
Farnham to Weyhill. Walworth cottages are on
the east of the intersection of the Harrow Way
and the north-westward Roman road from Winchester
to Wanborough Nythe, and not a mile
south of the intersection of this Roman road with
the north-eastward Port Way from Old Sarum to
Silchester. Between the Harrow Way and the
Port Way, and in this part of its course almost
parallel with them, is a road from Stoke and Newbury.
One of these roads is perhaps the road referred
to in the deeds as “Hykeynldewey.” The
Harrow Way, which still bears its name in the
neighbourhood, is not likely to have been the road.
The Port Way appears to be purely Roman. If
the road from Stoke were the Icknield Way, it
might have connected Streatley with Winchester
and Southampton, yet if it went to Winchester and
Southampton, it can hardly have been the road
which is several times called Ikenilde Street in
records of the perambulations of the Hampshire
forests. The survey of Buckholt Forest, under
Edward I, for example, contains the passage:
“Begin at the Deneway ... and so always by the
divisions of the counties of Southampton and Wilts
to th’ Ikenilde Street, and thence by the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
to La Pulle”; and “from Pyrpe-mere to th’
Ikenilde and so by the same road to Holeweye.”
This road I cannot identify, but a road touching
both Enham and Buckholt Forest would probably
reach Old Sarum.</p>

<p>There is an Icknield Street, marked as such on
the Ordnance Map, going north from Weston sub-edge
to Bidford, and, after a gap, from Stadley
north towards Birmingham. It goes for some
miles parallel to a much higher Ridgeway. It
leaves the Fosse Way four miles south of Stow-in-the-Wold,
near Bourton-on-the-Water, and is the road
described by Codrington as Ricknild Street. But
Codrington refers to a part of it&mdash;where the railway
crosses it at Honeybourne station&mdash;as called
Ricknild or Icknield Street, and to the lane north
of Bidford going towards Alcester as Icknield Street.
This road, or a longer one in part coinciding with
it, was first called Icknield Street by Ralph Higden
in the fourteenth century. It was one of his four
royal roads, and went from St. David’s to Worcester,
Birmingham, and Derby. Some of the manuscripts
of his work called the road Ryckneld, which
spelling may or may not have been due to the local
knowledge of a scribe; both English translators or
their scribes retain the R, calling the road Rykenildes
strete or Rikenilde Street. Mr. W. H. Duignan
(<cite>Notes on Staffordshire Place Names</cite>) quotes references
to this road in the twelfth century&mdash;between
Lichfield and Derby&mdash;as Ikenhilde, Ykenild, and
Ricnelde; in the thirteenth century as Rikelinge
and Ykenilde; in the fourteenth century as Rykeneld<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
strete. He also gives instances which seem to
prove that there were unconnected roads known
as Ricknield Street in the thirteenth century; and
mentions a place now called Thorpe Salvin, lying
on no known Ricknield Street, but once known as
Rikenild-thorp. Selden found a deed mentioning
Ricknield Street as a boundary near Birmingham,
and Dugdale one of 1223 relating to Hilton Abbey.</p>

<p>The <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Eulogium</cite> of 1362, when it does not call
Higden’s road Belinstrete, calls it Hykeneldstret,
though when Gale quotes it he makes it Rykeneldstrete.
Stukeley calls it “the Ricning Way,” and
complains of Plot for calling it Icknil Way; yet
he himself heard it called the Hickling Street
near the crossing of Watling Street. Holinshed
calls it “Ikenild or Rikenild.” In the time of the
second and third Edwards there were men named
after Ikenilde or Hikenilde strete (Pat. Rolls) in
Worcestershire. One of them was a man of Alvechurch,
which lies west of the road between Stadley
and Birmingham; and there was an Ikeneld street
in the sixteenth century within the lordship of
Allechurche in Worcestershire.</p>

<p>Drayton first distinguished between an eastern
Icknield Street and a western Ricknield Street.
He evidently knew the Icknield Way along the
Chilterns, and his words about Rikneld Street as
coming from Cambria’s farther shore until the road</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">“On his midway did me in England meet,”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>suggest that he knew the road as a Warwickshire
man, and that his distinction was not wantonness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
or the precision of ignorance. Gale accuses the
road of taking the name of Ickle or Icknild Street
without any just title. Guest also believes that
the western road “gradually attached to itself the
name of Icknield Street” as a famous name to
which it had no right. Wise, in search of something
to help him, suggests Hickling as the origin
of the name, but knowing of Ryknield, he is tempted
also by Rickley in Essex&mdash;confesses the temptation&mdash;and
“must now beg leave to call” the road
“the Great Ickle or Rickle way.” This use of
Rickling reminds me of a woman living in a cottage
beside the Ridgeway, near Chiseldon. I asked her
the name of the road, and she said, with some
hesitation, “The Rudgeway.” I asked why it was
so called, and she said she did not know. I
asked where it went, and she answered, “Oh,
over there!”&mdash;pointing west, “&mdash;to Rudge, I
suppose,” Rudge being near Westbury. An antiquary
in the <cite>Gentleman’s Magazine</cite> (1787) comfortably
explains the variation as due to the British
particle “yr” prefixed. But no one has found a
Ricknield or a Rickling or any such name along
the course of the road from Newmarket to Wanborough.</p>

<p>It seems likely that Icknield, like Watling and
Ermine, was a generic name for a road, whether
due to its use by cattle, to Professor Bradley’s Lady
Icenhild, or to something else. One such road in
Worcestershire and the west, and another in the east
tending westward, were possibly at one time well
known as continuous routes over long stretches of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
country. The two could be connected. Ermine
Street passed through Wanborough Nythe at the
west end of the Icknield Way from East Anglia,
went north-west to Cirencester, and thence both
north-east to Stow-on-the-Wold where it touched
the Ricknield Street and the Fosse Way, and
north-west to Gloucester, and so to Worcester or
to Kentchester and the south-west of Wales.
Another ancient road from near Tring, the Akeman
Street, would take travellers on the Icknield Way
due west to Cirencester, where they could branch
as they pleased to Gloucester and Wales or the north.
Thus at both ends of Ermine Street and Akeman
Street or their continuations there were roads known
as Icknield Street; it is even possible that the whole
system was officially given the one name of Icknield
Street, and such a system might fitly be called a
royal road. An eastern extension of the road to a
depôt and several ports in Norfolk is practically
certain, though it has not yet been discovered or
satisfactorily reconstructed. A south-western or
western extension beyond Wanborough is almost
equally certain. There is no need to look for a
road that is all of one type. Without antiquarianism
or modern regularity only common and continued
travel throughout its course can preserve a road.
Even during this extended use of it variants will
be discovered from time to time and used as alternatives
or substitutes. As soon as this use ceases
portions of the road begin to decay, and soon those
few having the old need for it will have found
another way. Each kind of civilization doubtless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
has its own special kind of road, and gradually
old roads are so transformed or combined
as to form such a road. But invaders or newly
organized people have to take what roads they find,
unless they have Roman will, forethought, and
resource to make their own; though by good fortune
men suddenly needing a road may find an
old one ready as did the pilgrims from the south
and west to Canterbury who used the Pilgrims’
Way. Men wishing to travel from east to west,
especially in the south of England, would have
found many tracks and roads of all types ready to be
linked so as to form a connection between important
points of trade, government, or religion. When it
became possible to traverse England safely, meeting
foreign faces and strange tongues but subjects of
one king, traders and travellers would piece together
according to need the old roads which different
ages had confirmed&mdash;the high and most ancient
roads like the Ridgeway and the Harrow Way, late
roads skirting the bases of the hills, pure Roman
roads fearing nothing, and Romanized trackways.
The Icknield Way may have been such a combination.
The Danes might have combined it with the
Ridgeway in 1005, when they burnt Wallingford
and went by Cholsey and Cuckhamsley to Kennet.
They probably used the road along the Chilterns
when they burnt Thetford and Cambridge and turned
south to the Thames; and other parts of it when
they stole inland from their ships through Norwich
to Thetford. Sweyn may have gone along it when
he went to Wallingford, and so over the Thames<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
westward to Bath, where the western men submitted
and gave hostages and he became king of the
whole people. Giraldus may have trodden it in
South Wales. At an earlier age, as Mr. Moray
Williams has suggested, the Icknield Way might
have been the line of the Iceni in their alleged
migration westward, after the defeat of Boadicea.
It should have been Imogen’s pathway to Milford
Haven. There are not many early references to the
travel upon the road. It would be used chiefly by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
traders and travellers from a distance. Plot remarked
that it passed through no towns or villages
in Oxfordshire, and this, in his day, made it convenient
for stealers of cattle. A road used by strange
travellers and robbers waiting for them was not
a likely one for small settlements and local use.
When it was spoken of as the way the oxen go&mdash;unless
the phrase implied a road along which came
oxen from a distance&mdash;it may already have been
degenerating. Guest says: “Your guide will talk
of the long lines of pack-horses that once frequented
the ‘Ickley Way,’ as if they were things of yesterday;
and a farmer in the Vale of Aylesbury told
me ... that in the popish times they used to go
on pilgrimage along it from Oxford to Cambridge.”
Messrs. Jordan and Morris (<cite>Introduction to the Study
of Local History and Antiquities</cite>) speak of the road
as connecting the flint-knappers’ settlement at
Brandon with Avebury and Stonehenge: “The
men of Wiltshire would wish to obtain flint
instruments from Brandon; men from Brandon
to have access to Avebury and Stonehenge.” But
Wiltshire men would not go to Suffolk in search
of flints except for a wager.</p>

<p>The Icknield Way is sufficiently explained as the
chief surviving road connecting East Anglia and
the whole eastern half of the regions north of the
Thames, with the west and the western half of the
south of England. For the men of Norfolk, Suffolk,
Cambridge, Bedford, Hertford, Buckingham, and
Oxford, it did what the Harrow Way did for men of
Kent, Surrey, Sussex, and East Hampshire.</p>

<span class="smaller">FIRST DAY&mdash;THETFORD TO NEWMARKET, BY
LACKFORD AND KENTFORD</span></h2>
</div>


<p>As nearly everybody was agreed that the Icknield
Way, coming from the Norfolk ports, probably
crossed the River Thet and the Little Ouse at Thetford
in that county, I went to Thetford. In the
railway train I asked a man who knew all the country
about him whether he knew the Icknield Way, but
he did not. He knew where the oaks and pines
grew best and what they fetched, the value of the
land, the crops on an acre of it and what they
fetched. He knew men’s rents and what each farm
cost when it changed hands last. He knew also the
men living and dead, and the lives they lived, what
they were worth, and whose bed they died in. He
was a man himself, a vast handsome fellow nearing
sixty, well bearded, whiskered, and moustached,
but not so as to hide full red lips and small, cheerful,
and penetrating dark eyes. He weighed eighteen
stone and a half and was not scant of breath, though
he smoked strong tobacco rapidly in a large pipe.
After much about the price of potatoes, etc., that
came in at one ear and bolted straight out of the
other, he told about himself and his family. Every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>one
at the railway stations knew him, and I suppose
he thought I should naturally not wish to remain
ill-informed. He was the youngest but one of six
brothers, all weighing over sixteen stone; and his
two sisters weighed over fourteen. He himself had
eight children, the sons above six feet in height, the
daughters above five-feet-eight&mdash;all of them persons
who would not be blown away in a storm. His
father before him was six-feet-three and weighed
seventeen stone. After a time, pointing to a satchel
with my name and address on it, he <span class="lock">said:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“Do you know anyone of the name of Fencer
in your neighbourhood?”</p>

<p>“No,” I said.</p>

<p>“Her father,” he said, “used to own the Largease
Mill. Polly Fencer. Very likely he has gone away
now. She may be dead. It is twenty-five years ago
that I am thinking of, and I will tell you what made
me ask. My next brother was in love with her
twenty-five years ago. She was a well-educated
person, good-looking, and had the nicest temper
of anyone I ever met, but not soft or at all weak.
She liked my brother; but she was a companion to
some lady and she did not want to marry at once.
He did, however, and when she refused to be in a
hurry he got cool for a time. In that cool fit he
married another woman and had plenty of time to
repent it. He lived with her twenty years and more,
and she was always ailing. He never cared much
about her and now she is dead, and it struck me,
seeing the address on your bag, that perhaps if Polly
was alive and free and hadn’t altered her mind, my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
brother might be glad to marry her. Certainly he
couldn’t do a better thing than marry Polly. I
know he never forgot her. But twenty-five years
is a long time, and she may be married herself....
I should have liked to see him marry Polly, one of
the nicest women that ever I saw....</p>

<p>“I used to be very fond of walking myself,” he
said, changing the subject. “And I still do a lot of
it. It is very good for the health. I suppose you
are walking for your health.”</p>

<p>As he perceived that I was not in business he
assumed that I was taking a dose of walking, one
of the most expensive medicines, and, as he believed,
one of the best. I left him behind me in Thetford.</p>

<p>This was a most pleasant ancient town, built of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
flints, full of turns and corners and yards. It smelt
of lime trees and of brewing. At the east edge was
a green “Castle Hill” and a surrounding rampart
without a castle, and between the ramparts, round
about the hill, a level green where people rest or
play in sunshine or under elm, ash, and sycamore.
Beside the steep artificial mound, so huge and uncouth,
men mowing the grass looked smaller than
ever, the children playing more beautiful, and both
more transitory. The dark hill seemed a monster
watching them at their play and work, as if some
day it would swallow them up. It was like a
personification of stupid enormous time. Yet this
ponderous symbol did not spoil the pleasantness
of the grass and trees and the green hill and
the little town, but rather increased it; and
I walked backwards and forwards lest I should
forget that I had been to Thetford, a place sometimes
burnt, sometimes fortified, by the Danes, and
once a bishop’s see. These things made the old
brewery seem older, the lime trees sweeter, the
high-walled lanes darker, as I walked about. One
of the lanes, Castle Lane, which goes through the
ramparts of the castle, is possibly part of the
Icknield Way. As you stand at the east edge of the
town, a little past the Castle hill, a lane comes slanting
from the north-east over the railway to an
open, dusty place, at a meeting of five ways, a
“five went way.” This lane, now only a mile long to
where it is cut short by the Kilverstone and Brettenham
road and having no obvious continuation to the
north-east, is the Green Lane, or Clover Lane, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
has been suggested as a Norfolk portion of the
Icknield Way. At the south end of it, in 1870,
were found remains of Celtic and Roman pottery.
Castle Lane takes up the line of Green Lane and
leads through the east edge of the town towards
the rivers. Before leaving the town by it, I noticed
on the right hand a very strange fish on a signboard,
a very curly fish, with curly whiskers, three
curled plumes on his back, and a curled tail; and he
was himself curled and boldly painted withal; but
whether this fish or the landlord was named Mullett I
have forgotten. My apparent road took me southward
over the Thet, and then the Ouse, by two low
bridges called the Nuns’ Bridges. Chestnuts darkened
the clear water of Thet. Between the two
rivers was only a narrow space of grass and buttercups.
Here, and a little east towards Place Farm, is
the gravel which fitted this spot for a ford. Beyond
the Ouse the main road goes straight away southward
to the Workhouse, the open, sandy heath, and
ultimately Bury St. Edmunds. On the left was the
isolated doorway of a vanished nunnery, and Place
Farm standing within a wide, low-walled space. I
turned to the right along a road parallel with the
river and divided from it by a narrow hedgeless
band of grass. This is supposed by Mr. W. G.
Clarke to be the Icknield Way, and he has sketched
it over the Bury and Thetford road north of the
gasworks, near where the remains of a British settlement
were found in 1870. But I found nothing
to save me from going on to the main road
to Mildenhall and Newmarket and then follow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>ing
that for two miles. On the ten miles between
Thetford and Mildenhall there is nothing but Elveden
Church, motor-cars, milestones, and dust; and
Mildenhall is only the half-way village to Newmarket.
It is a straight road easily provoked to a
fierce whiteness, and it goes through a dry heathy
land planted with limes and parallelograms of fir
trees. Nevertheless, a nightingale was singing at
noon in the blaze of a strong sun close to the left
side of the road, not a mile out of Thetford. His
voice in the heat was like the milky kernel of
a hard, bearded nut.</p>

<p>Less than half a mile past the second milestone,
and just over the Suffolk border, I took the opportunity
of leaving that road by entering a private
drive apparently to Elveden Hall. This was at
least in the right direction for Lackford, the next
ford, near which the Icknield Way is satisfactorily
ascertained. In three-quarters of a mile the drive
emerged into a road coming from the main road
I had left, and going east to Barnham. I turned to
the left along this to reach Marmansgrave Wood,
which sounded old, and at that point, as I hoped,
a cart track, crossing the road from north to south,
looked possible. As it fell out, this track was a
parish boundary and the boundary between the
hundreds of Blackbourn and Lackford; and for
more than half its course it was on one side or the
other of an oak or fir plantation. I went southward
along it, down the east edge of the long fir plantation
marked on the map as “New Barnham Slip.” It
was a broad and hedgeless track, often riddled by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
rabbit burrows which were masked by nettles. At
its best it was a rough, tussocky sheaf of cartways.
Everywhere sand and flints, parallelograms of fir
trees, nettles, and more nettles and the smell of
nettles. Rarely it passed a square, now, or several
years ago, given to corn. I like nettles, especially
with elder trees in blossom above them, as at
Lackford Road Heath, half-way along. There was
also some gorse. The road was not straight, but
wound along in a series of straight lines, slightly
up and down, but usually on the high level sand
with views of nothing else. I had no company but
pewit and stone-curlew and wheatear for those
seven miles, and neither passed a house nor saw
one anywhere. The sun blazed from the sky overhead
and the sand underfoot; it burnt the scent
out of the pines as in an oven; it made the land
still and silent; but it wrenched no word or thought
of blasphemy out of me. On the other hand, I felt
no benevolence towards the planters of trees in
straight lines; for by doing this they had destroyed
the possible sublimity of this sandy land, and at the
same time increased its desolation by the contrasting
verdure of foliage and the obviously utilitarian
arrangement. It was country which, if I owned it,
I should gladly exchange with the War Office for
Salisbury Plain. For if the nettles, the rabbit holes,
and the elders were exceptionally good they could
be equalled. The rabbits seemed to love the track
as in other places they love tumuli, and for a distance
they had wiped out its resemblance to a road.</p>

<p>Crossing the Brandon and Wordwell road at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
Shelterhouse Corner or Elveden Gap, I reached
the east end of the Icklingham belt of firs. From
near the west end of this belt goes a south-westerly
path called “Pilgrim’s Path,” down to Icklingham
All Saints’ Church. This is said not to be the Icknield
Way, though Icklingham, partly on account of its
name, and partly on account of its great age and
Roman villa, has been alleged to be on the road.
Two miles east of my road at Lackford Road Heath
is a “Traveller’s Hill,” marked by a tumulus, but
this is an east-and-west road and ends at a farm.
I continued over Jennet’s Hill and along the edge
of a second and greater Icklingham belt, and past
some cultivated fields, on the right, sunk two yards
or so below the level of the track. Then I dipped
down among corn and deeper grass, and between
good hedges at last, towards the River Lark, the
cool valley, and the broader woods of Lackford and
Cavenham. At the foot of the descent a road
crosses to West Stow, and in half a mile passes a
gravel pit and the place where Anglo-Saxon coins,
weapons, and arms have been found. After this
crossing there were water meadows, with swift
crystal flashing among buttercups and flag blossom,
the home of snipe. The great meadow on the right
is called Rampart Meadow, because of the sudden
lift of the land at its far side, which seems to be
ringed like an old camp with ramparts. Just before
the river the road became merged in the main road
from Mildenhall to Bury St. Edmunds. Alongside
the bridge was the ford, and the path to it was
hollowed out beside the road on the south. Over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
the bridge the boundary leaves the road and joins
the Lark.</p>

</a>
<div class="caption"><p>Bridge and Ford, Lackford.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Lackford is a village that straggles along a mile
of road with such intervals of foliage that I thought
I was past the end of it when I came to where I
could get tea. There was no inn; but the shop
was better than the inn could have been. My
hostess was one of those most active, little, stoutish
and cheerful women who never go out if they can
help it. Being descended from suffering and sometimes
roofless generations, they seem to see no
reason for returning to inclement nature when they
have a good digestion and a water-tight roof; they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
make good jam and good tea. There were a number
of things I should have seen near Lackford, such as the
burial mound, north of Culford Church, wittily called
the “Hill of Health,” and the road between Pakenham
and Stowlangtoft called Bull Road, and some
of the moats, at Maulkin’s Hall and other “Halls”
of Suffolk. But the Icknield Way turned sharp to
the right out of the road I had taken, opposite Lower
Farm, soon after the ford of the Lark. When it
was more important than the eastward road to Bury
the Way curved round westward beyond the river,
and its old course is marked by a depression through
the furze on the right, which finally reaches the
present road and is lost in it.</p>

</a>
<div class="caption"><p>Near Cavenham.</p></div>
</div>

<p>My road was now an ordinary white road between
hedges, but with a furzy heath on both sides beyond
the hedges. It had no grassy borders, but at the
turning to Lackford manor-house there was a little
triangular common on the left, of grass, gorse,
hawthorns, and an ash tree. On the right there
was a larger common, called Clamp’s Heath. On
my left I saw corn and a field of pale sainfoin extending
to the edge of a dark oak wood. The road
was, if anything, slightly embanked over this level
ground. After passing the Heath it had grassy
borders and low hedges and corn on both sides, and
then, after a short distance, no border, and on the
right no hedge. Where it descended towards the
woods of Cavenham it was sunk a little and had a
left-hand border of grass. Just before this I saw
the first chalk pit under the road on my left, with
wild rose and elder on its floor. At Cavenham a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
new flat bridge of two arches crossed a tiny tributary
of the Lark; but on the left of this was an old single
arch about seven feet broad of narrow bricks, still
firm but all grass-grown over its high curved crown
which passengers used to mount like a barrel. The
new bridge probably took the ford’s place. At
Cavenham the road went under the trees of Cavenham
Park&mdash;oak, beech, elm and sycamore, ash and
aspen. Turtle-doves were cooing unseen. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
house was some way off, the church farther, the
village yet farther along a by-road. At each turning
there was an open space for trees and men, for
example, at the two ways down to Lark Hall. Beyond
the second of these the road was lined by beech trees
and wych elms standing in grass: it was cool, but
gave a view of sunlit barley between the trunks, and
soon afterwards of an undulating lowland, heath
and corn, and wooded ridges on the right; while on
the left the land fell away and I felt the curve of
the earth, the wooded horizon being lower than the
road. Before reaching Tuddenham Corner the bank
of bird’s-foot trefoil was wide enough for a path;
only on the left was there a hedge, on the right was
tall barley. Past Tuddenham Corner the road was
narrow and shaded by beech trees of half a century’s
growth; it had hedges and grassy borders, and
down the middle two lines of grass between the
ordinary course of the horses’ feet and the wheels.
On both sides were many long, straight plantations
of trees, but in a low, cultivated country where they
gave little offence. Presently the road touched a
tumulus on the left, and drew near another on the
right. Then it was crossed by the Great Eastern
Railway, and turning sharper to the right than
probably it used to, went due west towards Kentford.
Being now a highway between Newmarket
and Bury St. Edmunds, it was broader, and had
also grassy margins of twice its own width, and
beeches in the hedgerows.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>Kentford.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Until this I had met and passed nobody, nor had
anyone passed me; no man of Lackford or Caven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>ham,
or vagrant bound for Norwich or Newmarket;
no long-lost sailor son whom I could tell of his
expectant mother selling roses at Piccadilly Circus.
At Kentford motor-cars tyrannically owned the
road. Here were men going into the “Fox and
Bull,” or standing contented by the “Old Cock.”
In the shade of the old flint church tower and the
chestnuts of the churchyard someone was cheerfully
clipping grass at evenfall. I looked up and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
saw a greyhound as a weather vane, and it was
running northward. A ford went through the
Kennett and a new bridge over it, alongside of great
fragments of an old one. Just beyond, at the cool
heart of the dusty roadside shrubberies, a nightingale
was singing in oblivion.</p>

<p>From Kentford the road ran straight for four
miles into Newmarket, taking with it the Suffolk
and Cambridge boundary now on its right and now
on its left. Telegraph posts and trees accompanied
it, and below them very broad, rough margins, half
overgrown by thorns and young elms, and marked
by half a dozen parallel footpaths. The old course
of the road from the third milestone was doubtless
the green track on the right, divided from the new
by a broken hedge; for it is this that the boundary
follows. Before the second milestone this track
traversed the new and was continued thenceforward
by a beech grove shadowing deep, narrow horse-paths
to the first milestone and the beginning of
the Newmarket red brick. On the right no hedge
came between the road and an open country sloping
down to the treeless fenland of Fordham, Wicken,
and Soham, where fifty feet above sea-level makes
a hill. Nearest the road were plains from which
tumuli have long been smoothed to make an exercising
ground for horses.</p>

<p>By the first milestone a child came running up
to me to ask if I had found a penny among the
trees, and I did not until afterwards suspect that
this was a brilliant variation from straightforward
begging.</p>

<p>As I came into Newmarket before dark, but after
the closing of shops, the long wide street and a
strange breed of men standing or slowly walking
about on its pavements made me feel that scarcely
after a dozen reincarnations should I enter Newmarket
and be at home. The man who discovered
that we are “all God’s creatures” had an uncanny
eye for resemblance, and I often doubt the use of
the discovery, without disputing its accuracy.
Everyone was talking of horses except those who
preferred lords and professional golfers. I saw
some caddies industriously swallowing temperance
hot drinks instead of beer, in the hope of earning
as much as James Braid at some distant time. As
for the horsy men, they seemed to understand
lords as well as horses, so well as to illustrate the
saying, “To know all is to pardon all”: nay! to
go beyond that, to admire all, and to believe that
men are more or less worthy as they are more or
less lords. One of them was imitating the bad
language of Lord &mdash;&mdash;, and it was admitted perfect;
but I can quite believe that to be a lord is
very different from being able to imitate one after
a glass of ale. There can be little doubt that to
the influence of either lords or horses, or perhaps
both, we must attribute the brilliant beggar at the
first milestone. A Scotch baker directed me to a
place&mdash;“It is not very elaborate, but it is clean”&mdash;where
I could get a bed such as I could afford.</p>

<p>I lay awake for some time listening to the motor-cars.
Most of them rushed through the town; a
few came there to rest and silence; others paused<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
for a minute only with drumming suspense. I
thought I should not easily tire of these signals from
unknown travellers. Not that I spent much time
on definite and persistent conjecture as to who they
were, whence they had come, and whither and why
they travelled. I was too sleepy, though at any
time such a labour would have been irksome. No;
I was more than content to let these noises compose
a wordless music of mystery and adventure within
my brain. The cars could bring together lovers or
enemies or conspirators so swiftly that their midnight
alarums suggest nothing else. It is hard to
connect their subjugated frenzy with mere stupid
haste. The little light steals through a darkness
so vast that the difference between a star and a
lantern is nothing to it. The thing is so suitable
for a great adventure that straightway the mind
conceives one. Hark! on a winter’s night the
sound and the idea are worthy of the storm and in
harmony with <span class="lock">it:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">Hark ’tis an elfin storm from fairyland,</div>
      <div class="verse">Of haggard seeming but a boon indeed....</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>It was easy to imagine myself the partner in
magnificent risks quite outside my own experience,
and to feel the glory and even the danger
with no touch of pain, whilst I lay as careless as
the friendly near neighbourhood of sleep could
make me. The touch of arrogance in the voice of
the motor is to its credit by night. In a measure it
revives the romantic and accepted arrogance of
horn and trumpet. It gives at least an outward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
bravery which has long been dropping away
from drivers of horses. I do not disparage the
sound of hoofs and wheels and the private voice of
a solitary traveller on the dark roads, but there is
something melancholy in it, and more endurance
than enterprise.... But, above all, the sounds of
the motor-car have added immensely to the London
night, at least for good sleepers with minds at ease.
Formerly, to those out of the Covent Garden routes,
the only sound of night travel at all provoking to
the mind was the after-midnight hansom’s clatter,
which challenged conjecture more often than imagination;
I pictured most likely a man with bleared
eyes and a white shirt who had let his cigar out&mdash;at
most, a man whose achievement was behind
rather than before him; and certainly I was always
very well content to be in bed. But the motor-horn
is turbulent and daring, though it may be
innocent to say so. Even if it is coming home there
is a proud possibility of distance left behind, and
either it seems that the arrivers have not returned
for nothing or the sudden stop suggests at the least
a sublimity of dejection from proud heights. As
to the car setting out in darkness, it gathers to itself
all the pomp of setting out, as we have imagined
or read of it in stories of soldiers, travellers or
lovers, and as we have experienced it when
children, going to fish or to find bird’s nests or
mushrooms, and as we still fancy it would be for
ourselves, were we ever to advance towards adventures.
I suppose, also, that the speed of a motor-car,
to the outsider, unconsciously suggests a race,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
an unknown end, an untold prize.... These
thoughts and mere listening to the horns and
machinery occupied me and led on to sleep
in such a manner that I ignored a man next
door imitating a gramophone quite seriously, and
in less than half an hour I was asleep and began to
dream drivel.</p>

<span class="smaller">SECOND DAY&mdash;NEWMARKET TO ODSEY, BY ICKLETON
AND ROYSTON</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Next morning I paid two shillings and set out
at six o’clock. So far as is known the Icknield
Way, which certainly went through Newmarket,
is the central street and London road, and along
this I mounted out of the town. The road was a
straight and dusty one, accompanied by a great
multitude of telegraph wires, on which corn buntings
were singing their dreary song. On the right was
the main stretch of Newmarket Heath, then a
few gentle green slopes, with clusters of ricks and
squares of corn, rising to a low wooded ridge far
off. It was beginning to be hot, though it was
windy and the deep blue of the sky was visible
only through folds in the hood of grey clouds.</p>

<p>There were dusty tracks for exercising horses on
both sides of the road. I like to see fine horses
running at full speed. To see this sight, or hounds
running on a good scent, or children dancing,
is to me the same as music, and therefore, I suppose,
as full of mortality and beauty. I sat down
for some time watching the horses.</p>

</a>
<div class="caption"><p>Devil’s Ditch.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Beyond the second milestone, and just before the
turning to the right for Cambridge, the road passed
through the Devil’s Ditch, a deep ditch with a
high bank on the Newmarket edge of it, stretching
several miles on either side of the way from
north-west to south-east in a straight line. At
the gap made by the road stood what seemed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
be old turnpike houses. Beyond the ditch the
road was a hedged one, shaded by beeches on
both sides, and having borders of deep, dusty
grass, in which stood the telegraph posts. The
long, narrow copse of beech on the right was not
strictly closed, but remained unspoilt and tenanted
by doves. Yet it was not long before I began to
look out for a cart to carry me over the next six
miles of the straight road. Such a road is tiring,
because either the eye or the mind’s eye sees long,
taunting, or menacing lengths before it, and is
brought into conflict with sheer distance, and
the mind is continually trying to carry the body
over this distance with her own celerity, and
being again and again defeated and more and
more conscious of defeat, becomes irritated, if not
happily numbed, by the importunate monotony.</p>

<p>This was country, moreover, which the unaided
eye could easily explore. It lay open and without
mystery. Nothing had to be climbed or quested
for. Therefore still more did the legs resent doing
what wheels or other legs could do far better.
Any wheeled vehicle, from a motor-car to a legless
beggar’s trolley, would help a man through this
country. In Wiltshire or Cardiganshire there is
nothing so good as your own legs, even if they are
bad. But in Cambridgeshire I recommend elephant,
camel, horse, mule, donkey, motor-car, waggon, or
cart, anything except a covered cab or a pair
of hobnailed shoes.</p>

<p>A fine region spread out upon the right as I was
approaching Six Mile Bottom&mdash;a sweep of arable,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
mostly corn-covered, but with reddish, new-ploughed
squares, and here and there a team at work, rising
up to a copse or two on the low ridges&mdash;not a
building visible but a windmill&mdash;and far beyond
these, blue hills. A very simple country it was,
that might have been moulded by a strong north
wind when the land was docile as snow. Over it
hung a sky of perfect summer and a sun like a
god that made me ashamed to crawl as habit
and the necessity of writing a book compelled me
to do. It was a country for clouds, but there was
none. Had there been, I should not have been
so well acquainted with the hard, straight road,
often slightly embanked, or having depressions
on either side, and in the right-hand one several
well-worn paths. By the turning to Weston Colville
and West Wratting it went level and straight as usual.
On the left the corn was hedgeless; on the right
a low hedge separated me from ploughland and
the windmill on a mile-distant ridge; and the
depression on the left was thrice the width of the
road, and used as a cart track, with merely a
white centre and ruts among the flowers of plantain
and lady’s slipper. Many larks were singing.
I became a connoisseur in road-sides, and noticed
each change, as that when the road was cut or
embanked it usually lost its breadth of margin,
and that now there was a hedge on both hands
instead of one, and in them roses&mdash;the pink roses
which have the pure, slender perfume connected
by the middle-aged with youth.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>Fleam Dyke.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Past the eighth milestone the road went through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
Fleam Dyke, which is shorter than the Devil’s
Ditch, because the fen to which it stretches northward
is nearer. The ditch is on the far side, a
green farm track goes along the mound on the near
or Newmarket side. Just before it I saw a green
way, a parish boundary, branching up out of my
road eastward between separate thorns and making
over the highland to the valley of the Stour.
Beyond the dyke was another fine open cornland
northward, lines of trees down its slopes,
woods on its ridges, and the tall chimneys of
Cambridge six miles away. On the other hand
a beech plantation lined the road and shadowed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
the grassy edge on which I walked. After the
beeches there were wayside roses, and a low hedge
and still a broad, grassy border, where the short-tailed
young blackbirds hurried before me among
the paper wrappers of sausages, etc., thrown out
by motorists from Cambridge.</p>

<p>On my right was an artificial wall of turf going
in the same direction as the road. This might have
been an ancient earthwork, if the map had not said
“Old Railway.” A disused railway embankment
gave me more pleasure than a prehistoric dyke.
It was also charming in itself, and had thorns prettily
growing on its green slopes. Soon it was changed
to a cutting, and, above it, a little round rise crowned
by eight poor firs in a tragic group, a few hundred
yards from the road. Past the tenth milestone the
main road reaches Worsted Lodge and crosses the
straight line of a Roman road from Grantchester
and Godmanchester. The line of my road is continued
by a lesser way to Babraham and Pampisford,
but the road itself turns abruptly from a
south-westerly almost to a southerly course, yet
still straight. Nearly all the roads hereabout were
as straight as if Roman, the low and even land
offering no impediments. There was one, for
example, parallel with the Roman road and crossing
the Icknield Way exactly at the tenth milestone,
having come down from Fulbourn Valley Farm
alongside a regiment of beeches, and continuing,
after an interruption by a kitchen garden, to Gunner’s
Hall beyond. Between this and the Roman
road, at the wayside, was a long, flint-tiled building<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
of respectable age, with a mansard roof, small
latticed windows in three tiers, and a louvre on
top like a small oast cone. The line of the old railway
continued to be marked by a slight bank and
thickets of thorns. My road had broad green
borders which the copse of Grange Farm interrupted.
There were now more copses, and the
land was more broken up, though still mainly
supporting corn and hurdled sheep. At Bourn
Bridge, near the twelfth milestone, there was a
ford through the Granta, shaded by elms and
poplars and occupied by cattle swishing their
tails in silence. At the milestone the common
road to Royston branches off to the right with
broad green borders, but my way lay straight on
over the new railway by Pampisford station
and through Brent Ditch. After the thirteenth
milestone the old railway had gathered quite a
copse of ash and thorn and brier about it. Near
the fourteenth milestone I began to see a pleasant
valley land below on the right, and groves marking
the Cam’s course by the spires of Hinxton and
Ickleton, and beyond them gentle, bare hills with
crowns of trees. At this milestone I saw myriads
of a most delicate blue flax shuddering in the
wind. Here Essex comes up to the road and
pursues it to Ickleton, even though at Stump Cross
it turns sharp to the right out of the London road
and becomes a lane to Ickleton, a green lane with
white ruts making for the church, and crossing
an artificial embankment which turned out to
be the old railway again. My road forded the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
Cam at Ickleton. This was a quiet white and
grey village, built partly about the road which
encircles the church, but chiefly on both sides
of a road leading west. The walls were of flint
or of plaster, sometimes decorated with patterns
in line, and there was abundant thatch. Here
and there the cottages were interrupted and a
gateway opened into a farm-yard. The church,
a flint one, was as cool as it was old, and full of
christened sunlight and the chirping of sparrows.
There were many tablets in it to the memory of
people named Hanchett&mdash;a name not in the <cite>Dictionary
of National Biography</cite>. The most conspicuous thing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
in the church was a circular frame over an arch,
enclosing the inscription in large letters: “This
church was repair’d 1820. Henry Chambers and
John Hill, Churchwardens.” Much smaller letters
below said: “Fear God and honour the King.”</p>

<div class="caption"><p>Ickleton.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Leaving Ickleton by its chief street, Abbey Street,
I entered an open country rising on all sides. I
took the south-westerly road towards Elmdon, and
then a right-hand turning out of that which went
in a straight line to Ickleton Granges. This
is probably a new country road, with hedges and
only the narrowest of green strips beside it: it
is not the Icknield Way. The old road possibly
ran along the gently rising ploughland half-way
up it, past Rectory Farm. There is still a footpath
from near Abbey Farm and the Priory remains
to Rectory Farm, which may represent the course
of the Icknield Way, continued by a broken line
of thorns reaching almost to Ickleton Granges
fifty or a hundred yards north-west of the present
road. Past the Granges I turned sharp to the
right along a drove coming through the corn from
Littlebury and Saffron Walden. At a turning on
the left to Redland’s Hall this road became a
county boundary, and I went uphill to the corner
of a copse, where it made another bend westward.
At the bend there was a triangle of turf upon the
right, so that the right-hand bank, which lies
beyond this turf, suggested a road coming from the
east, that is to say from Rectory Farm and Ickleton
Priory. The road was now well up above the land
to its right, and I could see the straight ridge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
near Cambridge which carries the Mare Way. On
the other hand were the gentle Anthony Hill and
Clay Hill, and in front the high land above Royston
and its straight bars of wood. The road was making
almost due west for Royston. It went between
corn, clover, or new-ploughed land; white bryony
grew in its low hedges, and even sprawled over the
dusty, rabbity mound by the wayside; and it
had grass borders of its own width. At first it
was rough, but hard and white. Soon it became
practically a green road, and then wholly so, but
level and rideable. In one place it was lined by
lime trees; in others all was elder flower, wild<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
rose, and lady’s slipper, and the chatter of young
birds. Beyond the road to Dottrell Hall and the
lovely group of sycamore and hornbeams at the
crossing, it was much worn again. It was a farm
road used only by waggons and men between field
and field, or at most between farm and farm. It
might have seemed no more than a series, four
miles long, of consecutive cart tracks, rarely with
a hedge on both sides, between it and the cultivated
land. It gave a sense of privacy and freedom
combined. At a cottage, one of two that had once
been a single farm, and still had a thatched shed
and a weedy yard, I knocked to ask for water.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 550px;">

</a>
<div class="caption"><p>Approaching Royston.</p></div>
</div>

<p>A huge wheel and windlass and a seven-gallon tub
stood above a well in the yard. A wild-looking cat
bounded through the window of one of the cottages
which seemed to be empty. The other might also
have been empty, in spite of its dirty muslin curtain,
for I knocked long and no one came. Just as I
was turning to get water for myself a human being
with black hair and wild eyes looked out of an
upper window and hailed me with a kind of scream.
As she was not half dressed, I told her to leave
me to look after myself. The well seemed bottomless,
but I had the seven gallons of dark, bright
water up on the edge by the time my hostess appeared
with a dirty cup. She was a thin, hawk-faced
woman, bare and brown to the breast, and
with glittering blue eyes, and in her upper jaw
three strong teeth. She was dressed in black rags.
She shaded her eyes to look at me, as if I were half
a mile away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>“You’re thin, boy,” she said, “like me.”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>A pause.</p>

<p>“Are you middling well off?”</p>

<p>“Yes, middling. Are you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, middling; but times are hard.”</p>

<p>“They are.”</p>

<p>She looked extraordinarily sad, and I <span class="lock">said:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“Still, we shall have a few years to wait for the
workhouse.”</p>

<p>“Have to wait a few years!” she repeated,
very serious, though smiling. “Have you come
from Royston?”</p>

<p>“No; Newmarket.”</p>

<p>“Newmarket. Are you going far?”</p>

<p>“To Odsey, between Royston and Baldock.”</p>

<p>“It’s a long way. You’re thin, boy.”</p>

<p>“Food doesn’t nourish me. Men cannot live
on bread only, not even brown bread made at
home.”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Now in the moon, perhaps, I should get fat.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps indeed, and I too. But look at the
moon. You give me the horrors. You couldn’t
live <em>there</em>.”</p>

<p>It was a thin three-quarters of a circle in a hot
sky.</p>

<p>“But,” I said, “I should like to try.”</p>

<p>“Would you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, provided I were someone different. For,
as for me, this is no doubt the best of all possible
worlds.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>“Better than the moon?”</p>

<p>“Yes, better than the moon; and there is nothing
better in it than your well water, missus. Good
afternoon.”</p>

<p>Framed clearly against her solitary pink-washed
cottage, she stared after me, shading her eyes.</p>

<p>Two or three times along these four miles of road
I saw a square of trees protecting a farm or
“grange,” most of the villages having a grange
out in the open country named after them, as
Duxford Grange, Ickleton Grange, Chrishall Grange,
Heydon Grange. But on the road itself there were
no houses except Noon’s Folly and one called
Shapens, not even at the crossings of more important
roads. For the most part it kept level:
where it had to dip slightly after the turn to Great
Chishall it was worn several feet deep, but this was
exceptional. Beyond that it was worn unevenly
into two parallel tracks between hedges with beech
trees and elders. To the right the pleasant tree-crowned
rise of Goffer’s Knoll stood up on the other
side of the main Newmarket and Royston road,
now fast nearing my road. Past Noon’s Folly Farm
the road had a narrow and embanked course,
but parallel with it a depression seamed by paths
and cart tracks. Here and for some way past&mdash;from
half-way between Noon’s Folly and the Barley
road&mdash;the way is a boundary between Cambridgeshire
and Hertfordshire. I had not been out of
Cambridgeshire since I left Suffolk at the Kennett
bridge.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>Icknield Way, crossing Ermine Street.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Half a mile west of Noon’s Folly the main road<span class="pagenum">
><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
reached my road, and, turning west instead of
south-west, made use of its course for the two
miles into Royston. For most of the two miles this
piece of road, exactly continuing my old way,
had broad green edges, and on the left hand, beeches.
Coming to a rise it was cut through the ridge and embanked
again below. It went straight through the
big village or little town of Royston, where it crossed
Ermine Street, and took the name of Baldock Street
from the town ahead. As it was market day everyone
was driving out of Royston with his trap full of
chickens and parcels of all kinds, not to speak of
wife and children. This was my first real chance
of a lift. For between Ickleton and the Royston
road only farm waggons went, and they were all
in the hayfields; and only motor-cars travelled the
road from Newmarket, all passing me as if I
needed nothing but more dust to fill eyes, mouth,
nose, ears, shoes, and spirit. I have never been
offered a lift by a stranger in a motor-car, but
friends of mine have told me they have heard of
others who have. With the increase of dust and heat
the likelihood of a merciful motorist becomes less, because
dust and heat do not produce the appearance
desirable in a motorist’s companion; in fact, by
the end of the day, or of the week, especially if he
has forgotten to shave, or has always arrived in a
town after shop-shutting, the wayfarer runs the
risk of being called “mate” by the baker’s man
who refuses to let him ride. “Mate” sounds
like liberty, equality, and fraternity, but it can
really be contemptuous pity. It is no better than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
“my man” from a gentleman, or “unfortunate
sister” from a lady, or “my friend” from a Nonconformist
minister. In London it may be different,
and I should say that a navvy would use it in a
friendly manner. But from the Wallingford baker’s
man on a country round it means “Poor &mdash;&mdash;,”
perhaps even “Dirty &mdash;&mdash;.” By this time essays
on walking and walking tours begin to wear very
thin. You pitch Stevenson at any rate over the
hedge, and cannot find a place suitable for &mdash;&mdash; and
&mdash;&mdash;. Borrow is safe, but then, he got really tired,
and did not regard walking as an amusement.
I have no doubt that he had learned to stick out
his under-lip at the end of some of his marches.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, stumping along on a shoeful of
blisters is not bad when you are out of Royston
and have Pen Hills upon your left; low, insignificant,
restful stretches upon your right; and Odsey before
you in the cool of evening. For some distance
there was no hedge on the left side of the road
beyond the town, and the turf, marked for many
yards with tracks made before metalling, rose
up to considerable swells of chalk cloven sometimes
gently and sometimes abruptly into coombes, some
smooth as lawns, some beautiful with trees. Tumuli
were scattered over this smoothest sward, and down
from the ridge of the high land came deep, curving
trackways. At Odsey beyond they have found
with Samian pottery the shin bones of men who
ran instead of walking. People were walking for
pleasure on the grass up above, and children were
laughing somewhere near but out of sight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>It was one of those delicious cool ends to perfect
days which give a man the feeling of having accomplished
something, but by no means compel him
to inquire what. The road still possessed the hills
even when it was enclosed on both sides, for it
kept broad margins, the hedges were low between
it and the grass or corn land, and it mounted higher
and higher. They were the gentlest of chalk hills
crested with trees&mdash;Thrift Hill, Gallows Hill,
Crouch Hill, Pott’s Hill, Rain Hill, Wheat Hill,
Windmill Hill, and Weston Hills&mdash;and at their
highest points there were villages, like Therfield,
Kelshall, Sandon, Wallington, Clothall, Weston.
I had still four or five miles to walk at the feet of
these hills, through a silence undisturbed by the
few market carts at long intervals. I am glad now
that I walked them. It seems to me now that
my purely physical discomfort intensified the
taste of the evening’s beauty, as it certainly made
sweeter the perfection of enjoyment which I imagine
possible at such an hour and in such a place. The
road was serpentining very little, but enough to
conceal from me for a long time the chief wayside
marks ahead, as well as my destination. I could
always see about a quarter of a mile before me,
and there the white ribbon disappeared among
trees. And this quarter-mile was agreeable in
itself, and always suggesting something better
beyond, though itself a sufficient end, if need were.
Moreover, I was looking out for a house which
I had never seen or heard described. A wood-pigeon
came sloping down from the far sky with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
fewer and fewer wing strokes and longer and longer
glidings upon half-closed wings as it drew near its
home tree. It disappeared; another flew in sight
and slanted downward with the same “folding-in”
motion; and then another. The air was silent
and still, the road was empty. The birds coming
home to the quiet earth seemed visitors from
another world. They seemed to bring something
out of the sky down to this world, and the house
and garden where I stayed at last were full of this
something. I heard rooks among the tall beeches
of just such a house as I knew I ought to have
been able to imagine, with the help of the long
white road and the gentle hills, the tall trees, the
rooks, and the evening. There were flowers and
lawns, beeches and sycamores, belonging to three
centuries, perhaps more, and stately but plain
red brick of the same date, and likely to endure
for a yet longer period, if not by its own soundness,
then by its hold upon the fantasy of men who
build nothing like it.</p>

<p>The rooks had been talking in my sleep much
too long before I started next day. Their voices
and the blazing window-blind described the morning
for me before I stirred. I could see and feel it all;
and if I could write it down as I saw and felt it
this would be a good book and no mistake. The
long grasses were dewy cool, the trees lightly
rustling and full of shadow, the sky of so soft a
greyness that it seemed an impossible palace for
a sun so gorgeous. The thrushes sang, and seeing
a perfect crimson strawberry, I picked it, and
found that it was as hot as a strawberry can be,
and therefore at its sweetest and richest.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>Deadman’s Lane, Baldock.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Winding a little more than before, and still closely
attended on its right by the Great Northern Railway,
the road entered Baldock, or rather it approached
that town, and then, refusing to be a main road
any longer, turned off before the Toll Bar Inn
to the right. Thus it dipped into the northern
edge of the town close to the railway and the station,
as a long, sordid lane called Bygrave Lane or Dead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>man’s
Lane, past the gasworks, past the “Stag,”
the “Swan,” and the “Black Eagle” in a row.
This was the abode of the “Sand Boys,” who sold
sand all over the country, and bought bones and
rabbit skins. It is also the reputed scene of
the death of Gypsy Smith’s wife and his own
conversion. Past the nobly named public-houses
the narrow street became a lane, rutted and half<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
green, and edged on the left with nettles of wondrous
height and density. The railway was closer and
closer on the right; on the left was a new cemetery
behind tall railings. At length the railway passed
under the road. I was now again between high,
extravagant hedges of thorn and wild roses.
The road was wider, but rough, half green and
half rutted, and in places divided into two by
a thicket of blackthorn standing in the midst.
A nightingale was singing among the roses above
some old chalk pits.</p>

<p>After a road from a level crossing had come in
on the left, I kept straight on along the right
side of a hedge dividing the railway from a big
field, and past the left edge of a shallow chalk
pit. There was no road here, but several tracks
went through the long grass, and mistake was impossible.
On the right two paths went off to some
of the new houses of the Letchworth Garden City,
and to a building gigantically labelled “IDRIS.”
This was, I suppose, the temple of this city’s god,
though the name, except as the Welsh equivalent
for Arthur, was unknown to me. They say now
that Arthur was a solar hero, and when in doubt
men might do worse than to worship the sun,
if they could discover how. At Letchworth they
were endeavouring to do so. The sun was not
benign or even merciful in return for these efforts.
He responded by telling the truth with his most
brilliant beams, so that the city resembled a caravan
of bathing machines, except that there was no sea
and the machines could not conveniently be moved.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
At the end of the big field I crossed a new road and
entered among the elders and thorn trees of the
edge of Norton Common. Here there were several
parallel paths, and on the left behind a hedge
was a garden-city street called “Icknield Way.”
This represented the line of the road, but whether
this or the path on the other side of the hedge
was more on the old course I cannot say. Past
the houses “Icknield Way” ceased to be a road
fit for perambulators and became a rough track,
chiefly used for carrying building materials. It
followed along a hedge and past a sand pit, in one
place a little hollowed out. It was miserable with
the rank grass of newly “developed” districts.
After a road came in from under the railway on
the left, it began to curve away north and leave
the railway. Once more it was between hedges;
but with all its vicissitudes it had remained a
parish boundary all the way from Slip Inn Hill near
Odsey. It was going uphill, and presently I
could see not only the corn, sainfoin, and houses
growing round about, but in the south-west the
line of hedged and wooded hills above Ippollitts,
Offley, and Pirton. Letchworth was still in sight,
like so many wounds on the earth and so much
sticking-plaster. But, though behind me, it was
fascinating, like all these raw settlements. It is
a curious pleasure to see them besieged by docks
and nettles, and, as sometimes happens, quietly
overcome by docks and nettles. They look new
until suddenly they are unvenerably old. Letchworth
may turn out to be an exception, but as I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
hurried through it, some back gardens, some forlorn
new roads, and the tune of “She’s off with the
wraggle-taggle gipsies, oh!” sent my thoughts
mysteriously but irresistibly to the desolate new-old
settlements I have known.</p>

<p>At the hill-top the road made westward, a shady
hedge on the left, sunny sainfoin on the right, and
arrived at Wilbury Camp. The north side of
the camp touched the Bedfordshire border. The high,
irregular earth walls overgrown with thorn trees
made an uneven and much delved enclosure,
where it was impossible to distinguish gravel
pit from camp, and through this hollow and among
its thorns went the path I took instead of along
the southern hedge and wall, which appears to be
the canonical Icknield Way and the parish boundary.
Across it goes the hard road coming from Brook
End over Wilbury Hill and down to Walsworth.
On the other side of this road it was a wide, many-tracked,
green way, winding through open cornland
down to the trees of Ickleford; and on its
left, at the convenient distance of two miles, the
tower and roof clusters and trees of Hitchin replaced
the spots of Letchworth. There were hedges
with elms for the mowers to rest under, and on the
right was the white wall of a chalk pit, with roses
and privet overhanging, and black bryony and
elder growing below. The way descended to be
crossed by two lines of railway a few yards apart.
Between the two it was grassy and elm-shaded.
Beyond the second the road forded the River Hiz,
and even waded in it for thirty yards or so. Ickleford
village had a green with chestnut trees, a
“Green Man” and an “Old George,” and a church
wall decorated regularly all over with an incised
design of saws, swords, handcuffs, crowns, etc.
The road passed St. Catherine’s Church and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
“Green Man” on its right, and went out of Ickleford
at “Ickleford Gate” on the Hitchin road. This
it crossed and went against the course of the River
Oughton, which flowed and turned a mill a little
below upon the left. At first it was a green-edged
road of good surface, with hedges and telegraph
posts, making for the downs, for Telegraph Hill,
Deacon Hill, and Tingley Wood, between Pirton<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
and Lilley. But at the mill, its modern use gone,
the road was once more a broad, green way dipping
with many ruts down among the willowy buttercup
meads of the Oughton. Doves cooed; blackcaps
poured out their cool, fiery wine of melody;
and the cattle meditated about nothing under the
elms. The road was rising again, crossed the Pirton
and Hitchin road at Punch’s Cross, and entered
through the gate of an oat-field, travelling along its
hedge and out by another gate. At Punch’s Cross
it became a parish boundary, which it ceased to be
at the River Hiz. Up on the right above the ploughland
lay Tingley Wood and a beech clump. On the
left charlock and corn divided by elms and hedges
extended to a wall of low wooded hills. Out of
the field the way was a green-hedged lane entered
under the rustling welcome of beech trees. Then
it became part of the main road from Barton-in-the-Clay
to Hitchin, and at the turning southward to
Offley a boundary between Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire.
This part of the road was partly on a
terrace along the side of a hill sloping to the south,
and there were roses and traveller’s joy buds in
the hedges. At one point the land on the left had
apparently been too steep to enclose at its lower
side, and the hedge was at the top of this steep
portion, which was therefore a broad, rough triangle
of open turf beside the road. Beyond this
the way had good grass banks or level margins with
hazel and thorn hedges, and ash or elm trees above
them. It was drawing near to a rough and thorny
chalk hill called Deacon Hill, and as it was bent on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
climbing over this range, the modern road left it,
and, going westward, avoided the heights above
three hundred feet. The Icknield Way took a
south-westerly course, and mounted steeply up
as a green, almost rutless lane between high hedges.
It was green and even as soon as it left the hard
road, and now for the first time made a real bold
ascent of the chalk. It looked more like a part of
the Ridgeway, but for the high hedges, than the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
unadventurous road that I travelled from Thetford.
There were daisies all over it, and roses hung upon
either side. Nearing the hill-top it narrowed, and
had steep banks on the left with brambles and
thorns over them. But right to the top it kept
those high hedges. Below on the right lay a neat,
green-hedged vale and a long, gentle slope covered
with woods or horizontal lines of trees up to a
straight low ridge. Telegraph Hill, which the road
crossed, is over six hundred feet high. It is difficult
to understand why it should make this climb
instead of circumventing the hill by a sharp curve
southward. It never again does such a thing or
rises to such an altitude. At the summit a green
ridgeway leaves it. It was easy to glide into
this and wind with it to Lilley Hoo and Lilley.
The track was a hedgeless, green band among
thistles and isolated thorns, glittering dark hollies,
and ash trees. Here and there the sheep rested
in the shade of a little bramble and thorn thicket,
where an oak or ash buried its trunk, and roses
climbed. The clear, high tinkling of the bells
on still wandering sheep was almost as gay as if
the bells were on dancers’ feet. The turf on the
track was the finest, and was bounded by a tussocky
line on one side, if not both. And so it serpentined
on the high, flat back of the hills,
always among old, isolated thorns or small, clear-cut
thickets.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>On Telegraph Hill.</p></div>
</div>

<p>But this was not the Icknield Way, which
went straight over Telegraph Hill, and steeply
and deeply worn, down to a green lane on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
the other side, where it was joined on the
left by another track descending from a little
tumulus with two thorns on it. The green lane winding
south-westward was broad, but the spread of
the beeches on its left side was broader and roofed
it wholly; the turf was better when this line of
trees came to an end. Suddenly a chalk pit on
the left narrowed it, and this narrowness had
been continued on, and used for wheat as far as the
next turning. Thenceforward it widened, and had
rough hedges of elder and nettles, holly and ash,
between it and the undulating corn. In front
bulked the smooth ridge of Galley Hill. Past the
turning to Offley there were four or five tracks
parallel but on different levels, with an embanked
one in the centre. Soon it was again on the turf of
the Downs, curving around the right base of Galley
Hill, the open land on the left, hedges and fields
on the right; past the hill there were two hedges
and ploughed land on either hand. Hereby was
the entrance into Bedfordshire. Then it came
almost at right angles to the straight mound of
Dray’s Ditches, but turned to the right along it,
followed by the parish boundary into the Luton
and Bedford road. If, instead of going alongside
the ditches, I had gone straight ahead upon the
line of the way, I should have struck this road at
the sixteenth milestone, and at the opposite turning
to Leagrave which I actually took. The boundary,
on the other hand, went on over the main road
towards Houghton. The road down to Leagrave
was an ordinary hedged road with narrow, green<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
edges. After passing a little copse on the left I
turned on the same side, by an ash a century
old, into a broad green track to Limbury. It had
hedges, but that on the left strayed away round
a huge rushy space. Beyond this was the clean
orange wall of a sand pit, and then a green field,
and then the tree-tops, and the crowd of roofs and
the tall chimneys of Luton, and in the midst a
tower above all the rest. But the hedge returned
and the way narrowed, and it had to cross Leagrave
Marsh and the tiny Lea. There was a choice of
road or path. Entering the brand-new, jerry-built,
slated cages of combined Limbury and Leagrave
Marsh, I turned to the right along Limbury Road,
and found on my left the Icknield Way, giving its
name to an estate and a new street.</p>

<p>Leagrave Marsh was evidently a pleasant little
ford village before it became what it now seems to
be&mdash;a safety-valve for Luton. The harsh, new
streets led me to a rushy common threaded by the
Lea, and bounded on my side by a road that crossed
the stream with a bridge. At one side of the bridge
the “Three Horse Shoes” faced over the common
and along the water; ponies, traps, and dogs were
clustered at the door in the sun. Their owners
were either inside, getting hot, or lying on the grass
over the way. But one driver was taking his horse
and trap through the stream close to the bridge;
and the whipped foam was shining and the spokes
flashing. Some boys were paddling a little way
above; and above them the village geese were
nibbling among the rush tufts. In and out among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
horses and traps, men, dogs, boys, and geese, the
martins were flying.</p>

<p>The Icknield Way went between the new houses
and across the Midland Railway and so down a
field rotten-ripe for building into Oak Road, which
leads from old Leagrave into the Luton and
Dunstable road. This road interrupted my way,
which went formerly as a footpath straight across it
and into the main road a little west of the Half-way
House, between Dunstable and Luton. This path
was ploughed up and its course only in part noticeable
among the crops. The Luton and Dunstable
road now looked like a river and the footpath a
tiny brooklet whose drying up made no difference
to the main stream. But in Robert Morden’s map
of 1695 the “Icnal Way” is a clear, good road
past Leagrave and into Dunstable, while the
road to that town from Luton is parallel with
the “Icnal Way,” and apparently the same as
the road and footpath running half a mile south
of the present road and just south of the Hatfield,
Luton, and Dunstable branch of the Great Northern
line. This main road was a substantial, broad,
straightforward highway running along level ground
and parallel to the downs on its left. There were a
few beeches in its low hedges, and the margins of
grass were of the ordinary width and rich in dust.
Three or four miles of the clear hills, here and there
crowned by trees, curved alongside and then
slightly across my course. Opposite the turning to
Houghton the lime works of Blow’s Down broke the
green wall with white.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>Dunstable Downs.</p></div>
</div>

<p>As I entered Dunstable there was already a touch
of night in the light, and it fell with a sad blessing
upon the low-towered church and the sheep grazing
in the churchyard up above the road on my left.
The crossing of the Icknield Way and Watling
Street makes Dunstable. Watling Street was wider
and had the town hall, the post office, the bigger
shops, and the chief inns. The Icknield Way, known<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
first as Church Street, then as West Street, was the
more rustic, humble, and informal, and beyond the
crossing it had trees by its side; and this seemed
natural and just. It had become thoroughly
suburban before leaving the town and coming to
the smooth high downs on the left, where children
were playing and girls walking about above a field
of barley and charlock beside the road. On my right
there was a wide border of level down turf and no
hedge between it and the corn. The downs, or I
should say the Chiltern Hills, proceeded majestically
southward, but six or seven miles away advanced
somewhat to the east, half clothed in woods, until
the bare Beacon Hill stopped steep and abrupt above
a high plateau of cornland which fell away into a
broad, wooded lowland on my right. Round this
Beacon I could see that my road would bend; I
thought I could see the ledge it must follow. In
that lower land on my right there were several rises.
Such was the smooth, easy sweep of Toternhoe,
close to Luton; such the wooded heave upon which
rose the dark, noble tower of Edlesborough Church;
and such the terraced hill near Edlesborough, with a
few thorns on the slopes between the terraces, and
at its foot a long, neat orchard of late plums or
“prunes.” The broad, wayside strip on the right
hand sometimes showed the old course of my way
much below the level of the present road; and
after Well Head this lower course was beyond
and below the modern hedge. On the left, at Well
Head, I noticed a little hill on this side of the main
ridge very prettily terraced, with thorns on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
slopes between the terraces. At Well Head a deep,
smooth-sided cleft winds away to Dolittle Mill, with
the first waters of the Ouse. A similar cleft a mile
or so beyond, at the Cross Waters, close to the
entrance into Buckinghamshire, carries water to the
mills of Eaton Bray. As I came out of Dunstable I
thought there could be nothing there equal to the
sweep of the downs before me, ending in the wooded
Ivinghoe Hills and the Beacon. But when I had
gone more than half-way towards the end of the
sweep I looked back and saw that the downs behind
me were equal to those I was approaching, and even
advanced a little out of the straight like the others,
ending also in a promontory above Dunstable. The
air was now still and the earth growing dark and
already very quiet. But the sky was light and
its clouds of utmost whiteness were very wildly and
even fiercely shaped, so that it seemed the playground
of powerful and wanton spirits knowing
nothing of earth. And this dark earth appeared a
small though also a kingly and brave place in comparison
with the infinite heavens now so joyous
and so bright and out of reach. I was glad to be
there, but I fell in with a philosopher who seemed
to be equally moved yet could not decide whether
his condition was to be described as happiness or
melancholy. He talked about himself. He was a
lean, indefinite man; half his life lay behind him
like a corpse, so he said, and half was before him
like a ghost. He told me of just such another
evening as this and just such another doubt as to
whether it was to be put down to the account of<span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
happiness or melancholy. He said that he had
been digging all day in a heavy soil, often jarring
the fork against immovable flints, lifting more often
than not a weight of clay only just short of the limit
of his strength. He had thought and thought until
his brain could do nothing but remain aware of dull
misery and the violent shocks of the hard work.
But his eyes saw the sun go down with a brief pomp
of crimson soon covered up by funereal drifts, and
these in their turn give way to a soft blue, full of
whitest stars and without one cloud. They saw the
far hills once more take on their night look of serene
and desolate vastness, and felt the meadows of the
valley become dark and uncertain, the woods much
duller but distinct. The woods immediately below
him on the hill-side thickened and appeared more
wild and impossible; the road winding up between
them like a long curl of smoke was wholly concealed.
Slowly the solid world was whittled away. The
lights of the small town half-way across the valley,
towards the hills, came out.</p>

</a>
<div class="caption"><p>Beacon Hill, Ivinghoe.</p></div>
</div>

<p>As an owl in the woods announced the triumph
of night with one large, clear note, he straightened
himself slowly and painfully among the clods. It
would have been easier to continue his toil than to
do this, but he did it, and then cleaned the prongs
of his upright fork with the toe of his boot, prolonging
the action as if he either hoped to arrive now at
some significant conclusion with its help or feared
the next step that had to be taken. When he could
no longer clean the prongs he raised his head and
looked out beyond the woods over the valley to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
far hills. The quiet, the magnitude of space, the
noble lines of the range a little strengthened his
spirit. He remained still. The surface of his hands
was dry to brittleness; he was stiff and yet unsatisfied
with the result of his labour; he felt the
dulness of his eyes; and no thing or person in the
world or out of it came into his mind with any conscious
delight or quickness; yet he still looked
along the ridges of the hills from one end to the
other, from star to star, without a thought save
the sleeping, underlying one that he was growing old.</p>

<p>A motor-car climbed nervously up the invisible
hill-road, the lamps of it darting across a hundred
little spaces between one tree and another of the
vague woods. It left the silence stronger than ever.</p>

<p>The man leaned with his chest upon his hands,
which were upon the handle of his fork. Only a few
years ago&mdash;either three or four&mdash;he could not have
ascertained by any searching of memory&mdash;he had
been young, and treated with contempt or with
pitiful kindness by those of more years. But now
he had come by unknown ways to feel that he
differed from mature men, not by anything positive
that could be called youth, but only by some undefinable
lack which condemned him to a kind of
overblown immaturity. Thus when he consciously
or unconsciously demanded a concession such as
might be due to youth for some act or attitude, he
met, in the individual or in society in some corporate
form or other, a blankness or positive severity at
which he recoiled with open but as yet uncertainly
comprehending eyes. Of young men he was now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
sometimes jealous; of middle-aged men afraid and
no longer defiant. Towards the contemporaries with
whom he had shared thought and experience for
some years he felt jealousy, if he seemed to have
outstripped them in the unwilling race; fear,
if it was himself that lagged; and towards only one
or two a fair and easy freedom, and that only intermittently.
Therefore no more destitute and solitary
man looked that night on the stars. Yet they were
as bright and the hills under them as noble as
those we saw to-day on the road from Dunstable.</p>

<p>Suddenly he awakened and thrilled to the sound
of a woman’s voice singing alone somewhere away
from where he stood. He forgot who and where he
was. He was no longer weary and muddied by self-supporting
thoughts. His imagination went out of
him and grasped each note simply and boldly.
Where there had been nothing, there the liquid voice
mounted in its beautiful, unseen form amidst the
darkness. The singer was among the dark trees,
probably in the climbing road to one side of him;
the curve of that ascent, always a thing of simplicity
and nobleness, was now glorious, romantic as it
soared out of the valley to the clear heights.</p>

<p>Either the singer was walking slowly up or
she was riding, but no footfall or turn of wheel
was to be heard. It was a powerful voice, confident
and without care. It leapt up with a wild,
indolent flight, for one short verse of indistinguishable
words, in a melody exulting in the wildness of
love and pride of youth, and then fell upon silence.
That silence bore its part also.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>But the listener had no sooner lost the first joy
over the insurrection of melody, begun to consider&mdash;whilst
waiting breathless for its return&mdash;who she
might be, what she was doing now, whether a lover
was walking beside her, when she sang again, higher
up the road. The first note rose up to the highest
stars, clear and fresh and having a power like light
over the gloom. Other notes hovered after it at the
same height, and then with one swoop as of an eagle
fell to the earth and silence before even a verse was
finished. A low laugh drawn out very long an
instant afterwards confirmed the first impression of
the singer’s ease and joyousness. The man could
see her neck lifted eagerly and her eyes flashing towards
the lover or towards the stars, her lips parted,
her breast heaving with deep draughts of the night
and passion, her feet pacing with languid strength.
He himself stood still as any tree in the ebb of the
wind.</p>

<p>Oh, for a horse to ride furiously, for a ship to sail,
for the wings of an eagle, for the lance of a warrior
or a standard streaming to conquest, for a man’s
strength to dare and endure, for a woman’s beauty
to surrender, for a singer’s fountain of precious
tones, for a poet’s pen!</p>

<p>He trembled and listened. The silence was unbroken;
not a footstep or whisper was to be extracted
from it by his eager and praying ear. He
shivered in the cold. The last dead leaves shook
upon the beeches, but the silence out there in that
world still remained. She was walking or she was
in her lover’s arms, for aught he knew. No sound<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
came up to him where he stood eager and forlorn
until he knew that she must be gone away for ever,
like his lyric desires, and he went into his house and
it was dark and still and inconceivably empty.</p>

<p>As I turned into the inn and left him he was inclined
either to put down that evening half to
happiness and half to melancholy, or to cross out
one or other of those headings as being in his case
tautological.</p>

<p>The landlady at my inn was the first that ever told
me outright, at once, and without being asked, what
she charged for a bed, and as the sum was reasonable
I was doubly pleased. She was a jaunty, probably
childless London woman not far from forty, who
referred to her husband as “my sweetheart.” She
had a skittish, falsetto laugh, whether she was talking
to me about their old horse John and all his merits,
or to the labourers about such and such a “sweet
old house” in the neighbourhood. They were speaking
of the coronation bonfire that was building on
the Beacon Hill, and she became important and full
of reminiscences of the Hampstead Heath bonfire,
and, thereanent, the Spaniards, Vale of Health, and
so on. She hovered between them and me, anxious
to tell me that much as she liked a country life she
missed the gas and the bathroom of a London house.
Now and then she left us all, to talk to the parrot in
a loud voice intended for mankind as well as Polly.
Her “sweetheart” turned out to be a little active
man, superficially jaunty but silent and brooding and
hanging down his head. He was sandy-haired with
dull, restless, blue eyes, and had not recently been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
shaved. His turned-out feet stepped quickly hither
and thither. He was dressed anyhow and as if he
slept in his clothes to ensure a fit; a white scarf
was tied round his neck and his trousers were turned
up. He carried a cigarette either in the corner of
his mouth or behind his ear. He was one of those
creatures provided by an almighty providence for
attending on that “noble animal” (such he called
it) the horse; but this did not prevent him from
calling his own horse John “old son.” He never
carried a whip, because, he said, he did not believe
in hurting “dumb animals.” A man who knows
horses well is equally at home in town or country,
and though this man was as full-blooded a Cockney
as his wife, he was, like her, contented with his three
or four years of country solitude; it was, he said,
a “happy life, yes, a happy life,” better than
what we had learnt to call the “bustle and confusion”
of London. I asked him about the Icknield
Way, which he knew by that name, and he told me
that it was a Roman road and that he had heard a
man could walk on it for twelve months and come
back to the same place again. What that place was
he did not say; probably he meant any place and
imagined that the road made a circuit of this island
or belike of the great globe itself. There could be
no better landlord and landlady of a small wayside
inn with one horse, one trap, and one spare bed.
The bed was clean and comfortable, and I fell asleep
in it while the stone-curlews were piping on the
downs and a pair of country wheels were rolling by,
late and slow.</p>

<p>“Five o’clock, sir,” said the Cockney at my door
next morning, and I looked out to see a hot day
slowly and certainly preparing in mist and silence.
There was nobody in the fields. The hay-waggon
stood by the rick where it had arrived too late to be
unloaded last night. To one bred in a town this
kind of silence and solitariness perhaps always
remains impressive. We see no man, no smoke, and
hear no voice of man or beast or machinery, and
straightway the mind recalls very early mornings
when London has lain silent but for the cooing of
pigeons. That silence of so many things that can
and will make sounds gives some of its prestige to
the country silence of very quiet things. Therefore
when I have looked out of a strange window for the
first time and seen nothing move but leaves on the
earth and clouds in the sky, I have often for a
moment felt as if it were dawn and have slipped into
a mood of dawn; it might be possible on a cloudy
day and in a new country to be deceived thus even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
at noon. Thus the innocence of silent London is
transferred to the downs, the woods, the vacant
fields, and the road without a wheel or a foot upon
it for miles and miles.</p>

<p>I had about forty miles to cover before the end
of the daylight, so I had to help myself by driving
with my host and his “old son” John. I was now
thoroughly foot-sore. One foot was particularly
bad, and in trying to save it I used different muscles
in the leg, which were quickly tired. Then, to help
myself, I had leaned heavily on my stick at every
step and so brought arm and shoulder to a state of
discomfort, if not pain. Finally, the stick was unsuitable
for its purpose and sorely afflicted the
palm of the hand that grasped it. I had carried the
stick for many single days of walking and liked it.
For it was a tapered oak sapling cut in the Weald
and virtually straight because its slightly spiral
curves counteracted one another. But it had almost
no handle, and so drove itself into one small portion
of the palm when leaned on. It had also in the
winter shown itself hard to retain in the hand when
a few inches of it were in mud. Nevertheless, it was
so nicely balanced and being oak so likely to last a
lifetime that, for six years, I put up with its faults,
and now, having been in my company for so many
miles in a splendid June, it has a fresh hold upon
me. Also I am not certain that any other handle,
a larger and rounder knob or a stout natural crook,
would have been much better in a hand not made
of iron. Perhaps a really long staff grasped some
way from its upper end would be right. But there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
is something too majestic, patriarchal even, about
such a staff. A man would have to build up his life
round about it if it had been deliberately adopted.
And gradually he would become a celebrity. Of
course, if he had an inclination towards such a staff,
as the natural and accredited form among pedestrians,
there would be an end of the matter, but
that is not very likely in a town-bred Englishman.
He must meditate upon what might have been, and
be content to make five shillings out of his meditation,
if he is a journalist.</p>

<p>It was a pleasure to drive with Mr. Willcocks. He
became quite silent apart from civility. He evidently
understood the horse, and the horse him, in
the mutual manner usually expected from a legal
monogamous union. If he had sat on the horse’s
back the combination would have been nothing like
a centaur. But with one between the shafts and
the other holding the reins they were one spirit in
two bodies.</p>

<p>As we began to curve round the foot of the
Ivinghoe Hills, which were on our left, we passed
another but larger deep cleft, like those at Well
Head and Cross Waters, below the road, upon our
right, called Coombe Hole. There was another
Coombe a mile to the south; but before this I had
not met the name (hardly the thing, except on the
west of Royston) since I left Thetford. We went
close under the steep slope of Beacon Hill which was
tipped with a tumulus and scored upon its flanks by
many old descending trackways. Away to the right
there was no land so high as our road&mdash;about five<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
hundred feet; the hill-tops were half as high again&mdash;for
farther than eye could see; and to all this low
land of dairy and garden the road was a boundary.
We were approaching the place where the Icknield
Way is said to divide into two parallel courses. A road
from Leighton Buzzard strikes athwart the course
and following along this to the left for half a mile
you turn to the right into the “Upper Icknield
Way”; following it to the right you reach Ivinghoe
and there turn to the left into the “Lower Icknield
Way.” We were going to take the Upper, so called
as being higher up the slope of the land. Just
before the Leighton Buzzard road we passed on our
left a long cleft, smooth and flat-bottomed, with
horses feeding in it, and hereabouts the old course
or part of its original width was clear over the left-hand
hedge. On our right was a high bank round
which went the road to Ivinghoe, and this bank
would explain the sharp turn. Originally it may
well have been that the road forked, the Lower
going past the old windmill straight ahead and so
to Pitstone Green and missing Ivinghoe; the Upper
going with it to the old windmill and there diverging
to the left past Pitstone Church and out into the
road now marked “Upper Icknield Way” at Folly
Farm. Along this road there was a border of close
grass; chestnuts or sycamores of about thirty years
stood up here and there in the hedge, and over it I
saw Ivinghoe Church tower and the silly spire, short
and sharp, on top of it, the misty woods behind, and
the protuberance of Southend Hill, having its sides
carved into thorny terraces, “linces” or “lin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>chetts”;
the Pitstone Church tower and an elm,
throned on a rise together, and the broad wooded
valley beyond. The air was sweet now with roses,
now with yellow bedstraw. Larks sang, and a yellowhammer
that forgot the end of its song, and once a
blackbird. I had left behind the Ivinghoe Hills,
but Pitstone Hill, their successor, was of the same
brood. It was chiefly bare, and its flanks much-modelled
as well as scarred by a slanting trackway.
The land between the foot of it and the road was
carved with the utmost ingenuity of which chalk is
capable. Once there was a succession of long
parallel deep rolls at right angles to the road;
wheat and barley grew on them except in one or
two places where the fall was too steep and there
were thorns amidst the corn. I saw also several
of those natural walls formed by a sudden change
of level. These are generally used as divisions
between fields. Here there was wheat above and
wheat below, and along the bottom of the wall a
cart track went between lines of poppies up to the
hill. Another such wall, but higher, had beeches
on its slope, and it made a fine curve up to its end at
the foot of the hill.</p>

<p>Half a mile past the turn to Pitstone Church the
way becomes a boundary between Buckinghamshire
and Hertfordshire as far as the bridge over the
Grand Junction Canal, where I entered Hertfordshire
again, leaving it nearly two miles beyond and
not far from the junction with Akeman Street. At
a dip from Tring wharf the road narrowed and lost
its green edges, but regained them on the more level<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
ground. For a little while after the crossing to
Tring Church a narrow green track was raised on
the right above the road and between it and the
hedge. Here there was an elm, and there several,
and here an ash; and there was never no charlock.
The hills on the left were more and more wooded
with beeches; and they curved round so as to lie
slightly across our course. On the right lay the
broad reservoirs of the canal at the edge of the
Vale of Aylesbury.</p>

</div>

<p>Now once more the Icknield Way is thrown out
of its course for a little way, this time by Akeman
Street, a modern road to Aylesbury, the ancient
road from this region to Cirencester, which was the
junction for Wales, Devon, and Cornwall. It enters
Akeman Street a third of a mile east of the thirty-third
milestone from London. The Icknield Way
was presumably older; it was at least old when
Akeman Street was Romanized and came cutting
in a straight line across its meanders; and therefore
it lost confidence for half a mile and forsook them
and took to the Roman straight line until suddenly
stumbling upon itself again at one of its meanders
further on it returned to its old way. The scene is
like the picture of a wandering life interrupted by a
year of discipline. The stark telegraph-posts in line
seem part of the discipline. Possibly for years,
for centuries, the meanders survived, more and
more faintly, with the straight line, enclosing a
rough and crooked space. This space beside Tring
Hill should have been a common for ever; but
either it never was or a common award handed it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
over to the largest mouth. Opposite the milestone
it turns out from the main road in its old south-westerly
direction, and escapes the telegraph-posts.
For some time it was unlike its old self because it
had hardly any grassy margin. It went up and
down again and again, and often steeply, and the
more hilly a modern road the less likely it is to have
wide margins. Near Halton there was a wayside
border but little if at all trodden, and not fed down
by sheep. A traveller joining the road for a mile or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
so would have failed to see in it any distant or ancient
purpose; it was a winding country lane metalled
for modern uses, and by Halton House made polite
with firs and laurels. In one place, as we neared
Wendover, I saw the old course and its bank and
also a hedge beyond the present one. Past Halton
Woods the hills recede southward and there is a
gap of a mile between steep Boddington Hill and
steep Bacombe Hill. Through this gap comes the
road from London, Uxbridge, and Amersham to
Aylesbury, and the railway with it: at the entrance
stands Wendover. Through this long little town of
cottages the Icknield Way goes as High Street and
Pound Street. We were now close under Bacombe
Hill, with its camp and barrow. In front, jutting
out and making the road curve west before it could
resume its south-west course by a sharp turn south,
lay the Coombe Hill and its obelisk, Beacon Hill
sprinkled with thorns, and Pulpit Hill. As we
climbed the lower slopes of Bacombe Hill I
noticed that the roadside green had been dug
up and enclosed by a second hedge. Beyond there
was a good green margin now on the left and
now on the right, and beeches rustled from the
hedges; and on both sides grew corn. The
road went up and down, coming thus suddenly in
sight of Ellesborough Church tower rising pale ahead
out of its trees against the clear line of the hills.
Past Butler’s Cross, where the road from Aylesbury
to Hughenden and High Wycombe crosses, the
sycamores on the left were beautiful, and so were
the beeches, wych-elms and ashes following, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
then more sycamores, and still more in a cluster
above the high bank by Ellesborough Church. The
Chekers Park limes and ashes on the left cooled the
road until we came to a pool and Little Kimble
Church. Then there were more park trees, lime and
elm and chestnut, as we went up to the church tower
of St. Nicholas at Great Kimble.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>Ellesborough Church.</p></div>
</div>

<p>At Great Kimble&mdash;at the “Bear and Cross”&mdash;I
got tired of riding at a walk up steep hills
and down steep hills, and I took to my feet again.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
Just before the second milestone from Princes
Risborough, in obedience to my map, I turned to
the left and took the right-hand road at a fork.
For a quarter mile this was a narrow chalky lane,
having at its entrance a sycamore and a thatched
cottage, and traveller’s joy all over its low hedge;
but crossing a road from Great Missenden it became
more important, hard and white, with a green
border. I climbed up past the “Red Lion”
at Whiteleaf, under Whiteleaf Hill, crossed
the Wycombe road, and went down a hedged
and rutty lane, leaving the spire of Princes
Risborough half a mile below on the right.
The way was some distance up on a steep
slope, and itself in places so steep from side
to side that there were two tracks, one two yards
above the other. Then it was a broad track of
level turf, next a narrow and rough one, the ruts,
as near the Horsenden road, mended with lemonade
bottles and meat tins. That road also thwarts the
Icknield Way, and diverts it half a mile to the left;
an old course seemed perhaps to be indicated
by a hedge continuing the line of the lane behind.
Turning to the right out of this road the Icknield
Way was white with green edges, of which one
presently became a terrace above the road. Over
one railway and under another its level green
edges were trimmed with silver-weed; in the
hedges there were elms. Past the Bledlow road
it was a broad, rough lane, soon green, between
hedges; the Chilterns and Wain Hill woods on the
left, charlock on the right. It climbed until at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
“Leather Bottle” it reached its highest point
since Telegraph Hill, and it had woods both above
and below&mdash;which rarely happens to it&mdash;as it passed
above the head of a beech-sided coombe having an
entrance apparently higher than its back. There
were roses in the hedges through these beech woods.
The “Leather Bottle” marked the far edge of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
wood and the passing of the border into Oxfordshire.
Here a steep track slanted down from the
hill-top. The road was now narrower, confined
by a hedge and bank on the right and the steep wall
of the thorn and juniper hill on the left. Presently
another deep track came slantwise down from Chinnor
Hill towards Bledlow and crossed my way.
Beyond this the vale was lovely. At the foot of
the hill beyond the railway which followed it was
an irregular space of two or three square miles,
nearly level but not quite. This was divided into
large fields of grass or corn by scarce perceptible
hedges or ditches, and crossed by one winding road
visible and white at only one of its bends. Along
this road and the hedges a very few elms were
distributed with indescribable felicity. There would
be five at a bend; a row, then a break, and only
one or two more; and they made only one long
line. One of the fields so divided was lemon-coloured
with charlock; on one which was slightly tilted up
a few sheep were scattered. Beyond and on either
side of this space the trees were thicker, and closed
in so that two or three miles away all seemed woodland
with an interspace or two, then a grey, dim ridge
beyond, all under a grey-folded sky. Above the
juniper hill the jackdaws were jacking merrily.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 550px;">
<a id="i_t155"></a>

</a>
<div class="caption"><p>Near the “Leather Bottle.”</p></div>
</div>

<p>Afterwards the road descended and was a green-hedged
line with a narrow ploughed field between
it and the edge of the juniper. Above Chinnor
it was for a long way almost straight, broad
and green, with elms in the left hedge. Here the
Chilterns had beeches on the upper slope and dots<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
of juniper below. Suddenly after this straightness
the way had to descend a little over undulating
ground, and it wriggled ahead confusedly, narrow
and without trees in its hedge, widening where a
hump was useless, to the ploughland below. In
front now stood the clumped Beacon Hill above
Lewknor, which was the end of a long curve of
hills carrying the woods of Crowell, Kingston, and
Aston, woods reaching from the ridge down to
the arable in most parts, but with lawny or chalky
intervals. At the crossing to Kingston Blount the
railway came up to my road and from there went
close and parallel for a mile to the station of Aston
Rowant. It was here a broad green track at the
foot of the slope, though still above everything lying
on its right, and leaving the villages at least half a
mile on that side. It rounded Beacon Hill, which
was capped with a tree-clump and sprinkled with
junipers, and went along under Bald Hill and
Shirburn Hill, which was wooded. Before crossing
the road from Great Marlow and Fingest to Watlington,
it wound round a chalk pit and rubbish
heap. Then the telegraph-posts joined it, though
it was only a green lane in two terraces going under
thorny Watlington Hill, and past cornfields sprinkled
with charlock and white campion. At one point
ten elm trees, one a triple tree, stood out in the
middle of the wide green trackway. Beyond the
road from Nettlebed the way was white between
high, level green banks, and then long grass, thistles,
and thorns in a thicket, before coming to the elm-shaded
pond where a lane goes up on the left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
under more elms to Dame Alice Farm. Then it
narrowed and widened again among nettles and
elder, and a little farther it became a company of four
parallel grooves paved with the pure down turf,
a little silver-weed, and thyme. The undulations
of the cornland were bolder now towards Britwell
Salome, and in a hollow a roof nestled among elms;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
beyond these were dim, low hills. A line of elm trees,
now many deep, now in narrow file, half hid the
village of Britwell. Above my road a steam-plough
stood idle; the men lay on their faces under the
elms; and beyond was their caravan. Crossing the
Britwell Salome road I came in sight of the clear
heavings of the Sinodun Hills and their clumps of
trees, and the dim length of the main downs far
past them. Britwell House, looking at its monument
and Swyncombe Downs, lay a little to the right.
Down the slope of the hill at the north edge of
the beeches and firs of Icknield Bank Plantation
came a Danish entrenchment.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>Sinodun Hill.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Emerging from the trees the road was narrow and
hard, but sent a green branch southward over Littleworth
Hill, and the adjacent land was equally high
on both sides, on the left Ewelme Downs, on the
right Huntingland. I went along the south side of
Ewelme Cow Common, a shallow, irregular hollow
of grass, with many thorns and much bird’s-foot
trefoil in it, bounded on all hands by roads
without hedges. I entered the Henley road a little
west of the fourteenth milestone from Oxford,
and turned along it to the right, and then almost
at once to the left at Gipsies’ Corner, and so went
south, avoiding the road on the right to Crowmarsh
Gifford and Wallingford. Here was a new land
before me, of sweeping corn, big thatched barns
on a low ridge above it, and the main Downs
beyond. It was a narrow and low-hedged road
that kept away from the low, elmy Thames land
on the west. Over the hazels and elders of its<span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
hedgerows climbed roses and bryony. Between
Oakley Wood and Coldharbour Farm it made southward,
crossing the Nettlebed and Crowmarsh and
Nuffield and Crowmarsh roads within a few yards;
the three ways framing a pretty triangular waste
of impenetrable thorns, elders, and nettles. Sinodun
Hills were always distinct on the right. Then I
traversed Grim’s Ditch, where it borders the south
edge of Foxberry Wood and of a broad, herbless
ploughland; the ditch being on the south side of
the bank. In half a mile I crossed another road
from Crowmarsh, going south-east. There my way
ceased to be a road, but its line was clear along the
natural wall of earth between upper and lower fields;
and when there was no more wall, along the strip
of rough grass between two stretches of ploughland;
and when that ended, the course of the way
was clearly on a terrace with a central path through
the long grass and some thorns on the bank to
the right of it, between two fields of sainfoin.
Ahead, on the left, stood the little solitary church
of Ipsden on an east-and-west road from North
Stoke which I crossed. Onwards there was a rough,
hedgeless road still going south. After the next
cross-road to Ipsden the probable line was marked
only by a hedge between grass and arable, and even
that gave out for the last fifty yards before entering
the Mongewell road. Over this road a gap in the
hedge might have been used when the road had
dwindled to a footpath going to Glebe Farm,
which is on a road now largely used to connect
Brazier’s Park with Goring. I thought I saw the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
ghost of it coming down to Glebe Farm, though
amidst corn. This road to Goring is henceforward
along the course of the Icknield Way. It is a hard
and hedgeless road, winding and undulating through
corn that rises on either hand to crested ridges. It
passed Icknield Farm, crossed the South Stoke and
Woodcote road, and went up as Catsbrain Hill to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
where I saw below me the red roofs and walls of
suburban Cleeve and the Berkshire downs, their woods
and pastures, beyond. The road dipped, and at the
cross-road below was lost in streets and building
land. Therefore I turned west along the cross-road,
and then south again to Goring, the ford, and
Streatley. Goring and Streatley railway station,
and the cutting and the new houses have probably
covered up where they have not destroyed all
traces of the Icknield Way. But there is a Ferry
Lane leading down to the towing-path and river,
to where there was a ferry before the bridge, and a
“Roman” ford over the gravelly bottom before
that. On the opposite side Streatley Vicarage and
its lawn lie across the probable way, but beyond
them a path continuing the line of Ferry Lane
goes straight up to the Reading road a quarter
mile south of the “Bull.” I went into Goring
Church and churchyard, and was pleased with the
names of “John Lammas” and of “James, Ann,
and Ruth Thresher” on tombstones. What clear
visages of men and women these call up, each perfect
in its way, shorn of the uncertain, vague, or incongruous
elements of the living! By a kind of art
the mere names in the churchyard sketch the
characters. I have seen mere names that suggested
as much as those two beautiful verses express
which Mr. Walter de la Mare, the author, calls
“An Epitaph”:&mdash;</p>

<p>As if I had not had enough of it in passing through,
I walked out again to Cleeve, and looked at the
blocks of red brick houses. Only people with immortal
souls could be content with houses like those.
For a man without an immortal soul, but a few
senses for a substitute, a house like one of these is, to
use one poor word instead of a dozen better ones,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
unsuitable. I have lived in three, and one of them
would compete with any house at Cleeve for the
title of The Red Brick House.</p>

<p>The Red Brick House was a raw naked building
in the county of Kent with a triple bay window
to left and right of the front door, and, above these,
two large windows and a small one in the middle;
on one side there were no windows, on the other
only one very small one low down; the back was
flat and had a door between a large window and
a small, and three windows above. The roof was of
slate and low-pitched, and there was a stack with
three chimney pots at either side of the house, and
a single chimney at the back.</p>

<p>The house stood in a level, oblong piece of land
cut out of a large field by posts and wire, and
separated from the road by a cheap but rustic
fence. There were two other buildings of the same
species within two hundred yards, all looking
across the same road between elm trees to a ploughed
field, many hedges, a rise of orchard land, and some
heavy wooded hills at the horizon. For the sake of
the houses the elms on their side had been felled
and taken away. Breaking-down, temporary fowl-houses
were littered about two of the gardens,
which someone had begun to dig once upon a time,
and even to plant and sow; but there was not a
living tree in either of them.</p>

<p>The soil was light. There was no higher ground
in the near neighbourhood, and it had therefore
been chosen as the site of a square water-tank,
imperfectly sequestered among elms close to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
house. To the south the view was gentle and perfect,
especially when the blossom snow hung in
the orchards and the sky was milky soft above the
dark woods of the horizon. At the lower edge of
these woods stood a white house that was always
mysterious, even though it was often seen from a
gateway not a hundred yards distant. The Downs
flowed to the north. Eastward and westward the
last undulations of the Downs could be seen beyond
orchards and elms.</p>

<p>The village clustered round a triangular green half
a mile away, and in the woods on the slope from the
Red Brick House down to the Green, several bigger
houses half hid themselves, looking toward the
far Downs and the orchard rise. Many other folds
of the land held cottages in groups, farm-houses
and their spreading dependencies, conical oast-houses,
single or sociable, and not a few churches;
yet from the Red Brick House only the White House
at the wood’s edge was visible when the leaves were
on the elms of the hedges, on the orchards, and on
the oak and beech of the copses and greater woods.</p>

<p>All other houses that I have known, beautiful,
plain, dear, hateful, or dull, have been somehow
subdued and made spiritual houses in course of
time and of memory. The Red Brick House is
the only unconquerable one. To this day it remains
a body, and dead. Its fires are black grates that
burnt coal. Its walls are wall-paper in strips at a
certain price. Its garden is still mere hard ground
to be dug (and to grow chiefly the inexorable couch-grass).
I saw a beautiful spring come into the world<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
from that house: spring passed down the elms on
the opposite side of the road, led one morning by
a wry-neck screaming loud in the tops of the trees.
Pewits came to the ploughed field beyond, and
tossed in the sunny wind, as I would have done in
such days of March, had I been a bird. Beautiful
autumn, beautiful spring, beautiful summer,
triumphed round about that building. Many
days can I remember from those seasons, a February
day, for example&mdash;a pale morning after a night of
lashing rain, a pale, still morning. The puddles,
the ruts of the cartways, the smooth surface of the
winding roads, glistened in the brown, ploughed
world. The Downs were clear and dark and hard
under a silver-clouded blue sky, and far beyond
them were the upper ridges of small mountainous
clouds of a yellowish and sunlit white. Very sombre
were the woods. Each thing was dark or bright;
all was fresh and cold. Suddenly a bee twanged
through the air to a snowdrop on the south side
of the Red Brick House. Inside the house a subtle
devil was refusing to let a soul enter into its walls&mdash;a
subtle but a bodiless and soulless devil, negative
and denying. During the nine years since it was
built eight families had sojourned in the house,
and had not given it a soul; nor had the several
intervals of vacancy given it a ghost.</p>

<p>Sometimes death will give a soul to a house.
I once saw the soul of a dead man given to a new
little house with a verandah. The swifts were racing
to and fro between the rows of new houses. They
flew just above the level of men’s hats, except when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
they turned with a rapier-like twist up into the
air. While they raced they screamed continually
shrill screams of a fierce hilarity. There were half
a hundred of them all flying as upon the surface
of an invisible stream surmounted by a few black,
bobbing hats, or, very rarely, an upturned white
face; and no part of the streets was for more than
a second without a crescent black wing and a shriek.
They had taken possession of the town. Under
their rush and cry the people in the streets were
silent, walking blankly and straight ahead, and all
looking old in contrast with the tumultuous and
violent youth of the birds. The thought came into
my head as I was passing the last of the houses that
even so must the birds have been racing and screaming
when the Danes harried this way a thousand
years ago, and thus went they over the head of
Dante in the streets of Florence. In the warriors
and in the poet there was a life clearly and mightily
akin to that in the bird’s throat and wing, but here
all was grey, all was dead.</p>

<p>When I came to the bridge leading over the railway
to the meadows I stood and watched the birds
flying beneath me, above the slowly curving metals;
for I could not tire of the wings and voices that ripped
the dead air, and I crossed to the other parapet to
see how far they went in the opposite direction.
Then for the first time I noticed a house built
almost at the edge of the bank which fell steeply
down to the railway. Only the cutting separated
it from the town, and beyond it could be seen
nothing but trees lining the road, and fields on either<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
side as far as the woods of the horizon. It was the
last house of the town, and one of the newest.
Not being in a street it needed not to be exactly
like the rest, square, pierced with oblong windows
on two sides, and blank on the other two; but so
it was, except that its lower windows looked across
the railway between the thin, white posts of a
verandah. A strip of garden, not more than
equal to it in area, surrounded the house, and this
was enclosed by rusty iron railings upon all sides.
Every window was shut, and the light and air
blocked out by venetian blinds painted grey. The
white paint of the window frames and the verandah
was dirty, but the red bricks of the walls were still
harshly new and untouched by vegetation or any
stain. The garden had never been cultivated:
it was given over to long grasses of the unhealthy
rankness peculiar to soil which is composed of
builders’ refuse, and the stalks were matted and
beaten down so as to suggest the soaked hair of
something dead. The door and gate were shut.
The verandah and the white paint gave the building
a pretentious air of being a pleasure house; yet it
looked over the railway at the back parts of the town,
at the railway station on one hand, at the cemetery
and a tall chimney on the other. It had apparently
not been occupied or for a little time only, and was
now empty; or it had been used for a month at
a time by perhaps half a dozen families; certainly
it had never become a house; it was the corpse, the
stillborn corpse of a house.</p>

<p>Beyond it, between the two lines of elms and on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
either side of them, was the open country. The
road was old, too, worn down like a river-bed into
the sandy soil, and the elms above either side made
it dark as it rose towards the north. I had not
gone many yards along it when I came to a place
where the bank had been excavated long ago.
There was a smooth sandy floor, and behind that
a firm wall of orange sand interlaced by the stony
and snake-like roots of a great oak which towered
up from the top of the wall; and behind the trunk
the sun was a scarlet round in a dull sky at the
moment of going down. It was dark and still in
this hollowed place, and I had looked at it for some
time before I heard the crying of a child and saw
three children playing in the sand. Under the oak
they had dug a cave in the sand, and a black-haired
boy and a fair-haired girl were carrying away
little spadefuls, while the third sat still among the
roots. The two workers went silently backwards
and forwards. They moved gravely and without a
word, and I might have thought they were unaware
of one another had they not made way for one
another in their comings and goings. They worked
as if in a dream and being moved by some unseen
power. Their faces also were fixed and expressionless;
their wide-open eyes seemed to be upon something
which travelled always before them and was
invisible to me. They were perhaps seven years
old. The other was not more than three, and he
took no notice of them as he sat, his face smeared
with tears and sand, and a paper bag upon his
lap. Now and then he burst out into a fresh sobbing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
cry just as suddenly, and not more loudly than the
robin singing above his head. When he did this the
little girl went up to him and shook him gently,
and took a cherry from the paper bag and put it
into his mouth. At this he became silent again for
a little, holding the cherry-stone in one hand, and
with the other rubbing his eyes. When this cure
had been tried several times, and the scarlet sun
had gone down out of the dull heavens, the child
began to cry more steadily, and it was in vain that
a cherry was put into his mouth; for he held it a
little while between his lips, and did not notice
when it fell out, but sobbed on and on as if he saw
nothing, heard nothing, thought nothing, felt
nothing, but only sobbed.</p>

<p>I asked the little girl: “What is the matter with
him?”</p>

<p>“He wants his mother,” she said.</p>

<p>“Where does he live?” I asked, as I stepped
towards the child, meaning to lift him up.</p>

<p>“Over there,” she replied, pointing with her eyes
to the house of the verandah.</p>

<p>“Then why doesn’t he go home?” I said, stopping
still and thinking again chiefly of the house.</p>

<p>“His father is dead,” said the little girl and the
little boy simultaneously. Then they went on with
their digging, while I turned and saw the house
looking as if it had grown suddenly old in those
few moments&mdash;old and haggard, and so cold that
I shivered to think how cold it must be in the
death-room behind the venetian blinds. The silence
of the house and road was like a sea suddenly ex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>panding
infinitely about me. As I turned away, the
child’s sob, the song of the robin, the scream of
the swifts, fell into that dark silence without breaking
it, like tears into a deep sea. And I looked at
the house and saw that the soul of the dead man
had entered it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>Remembering this, I gave up my spiritual frivolity
at Cleeve, and escaped to an inn. I suppose
I had been too much taken with churchyard
names in the grey evening to be quite fair to
the living landlord at the inn. He was a short,
heavy, fair-haired man, who had a too distinguished
moustache, and talked through his
nose, and had a straw hat tilted back on his neck.
He and a wealthy Scotchman were talking together,
and invariably&mdash;by a slight effort&mdash;agreeing with
one another. His little niece came in with a flag,
but he successfully put her off by saying that he had a
lot of things to show her by and by, and she ran
away shouting: “Uncle has a lot of things to
show me.” He explained to the Scotchman that
he really had&mdash;“flags and things for the coronation”&mdash;“must
do something”&mdash;“everybody will”&mdash;“have
spent half a sovereign”&mdash;“it isn’t much&mdash;but
still....” The child, he said, was very excitable,
not that there was anything wrong; oh,
no; but she would make a wonderful actress.
He asked the Scotchman what he would take,
and then ordered two whiskies, which I understood
the other to pay for. They talked of drinks and of
champagne, of course. The landlord began laughing
at “some <em>ladies</em>” who like it sweet. He implied
huge contempt for a man who could like such stuff.
Nevertheless, he hastened to say: “You don’t like
sweet champagne?... No.... No, of course you
don’t.... Oh, yes, well, tastes differ.” This naturally
led to Freemasonry, and it turned out that the
Scotchman had done everything as a Mason (except<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
work in stone); had served as chairman, etc. etc.,
and the landlord showed great eagerness of admiration
by saying: “Have you really?” several
times. They returned to the subject of drink. The
Scotchman announced that he took nothing but
whisky, except when he had to. The landlord
hastened to remark: “You are quite right. You’ll
live the longer for it.” Then the landlord related
how when he was three-quarters drunk he always
found it so hard to drink champagne, which was
only good, really, if you were run down, or for
medicinal purposes. A very great deal of natural
philosophy was uttered over those three or four
glasses of whisky. After the Scotchman had gone
the landlord was claimed by two young gentlemen
who were staying under his roof for the fishing,
boating, and alcoholic drinks. They called him
“Arthur,” and lured him into frivolities which he
was not born to, such as arranging a band with
tennis rackets, etc., for instruments, and serenading
the other visitors and the inhabitants of the surrounding
houses. In the intervals they fortified
themselves with his whisky to such an extent that
his leniency towards its effect was not to be surprised
at. They also took care to keep up their
reputation of commonplace luridity with the barmaid,
a plain, hard-worked girl, whose smile&mdash;and,
they evidently believed, everything else&mdash;was at
their command. When he could slip away from these
sportsmen the landlord straightened his hat and
talked business to the barmaid with some anxiety
and no false generosity. But they were always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
shouting for “Arthur” in shriller and more discordant
voices until at last the second fiddle of the
two burst through the door of his bedroom and
rushed across and fell heavily on the other side.
Then his leader went quietly to bed. The landlord
turned to his accounts, and the barmaid went on
washing up glasses.</p>

<span class="smaller">FIFTH DAY&mdash;IVINGHOE TO WATLINGTON, ON THE
LOWER ICKNIELD WAY, BY ASTON CLINTON,
WESTON TURVILLE, CHINNOR, AND LEWKNOR</span></h2>
</div>


<p>I had to go back to the forking of the Icknield Way
and follow the Lower road from Ivinghoe. St.
Mary’s Church at Ivinghoe stands pleasantly among
sycamores and beeches, and next door to a small
creeper-covered brewery which is next door to a
decent creeper-covered house with round-topped
windows and a most cool and comfortable expression.
Some stout and red-faced men stood talking
outside the brewery in cheerful mood. On the
opposite side of the road was a green enclosed by a
low railing. The village was a straggling one, and
there were many newish houses, of pale brick here
and there, as well as old timbered cottages. I went
into a grocer’s shop at the moment when they were
killing a pig on the other side of the wall. Neither the
shrieking nor the end of it disturbed the stout proprietor
cutting up lard and the women talking of
the coronation.</p>

</a>
<div class="caption"><p>Grand Junction Canal.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The road was a dull, straight one going south-westwards
over the London and North Western
Railway a mile north of the Upper road, and two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
and a half miles north-west of Tring station. It
passed allotment gardens and had the company of
heavy-laden telegraph-posts, whose wires cut across
the terraces or “linces” of Southend Hill on the
right. But if the corn-bunting sang its curst dry
monotony on the telegraph-wire a blackbird also
sang in an oak. Beyond the railway the road was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
better and had level green edges up to the roses
of the high hedge on the right and the low one on
the left, over which I could see across the oats to
the Chilterns lying dark under the sun. On the
other side of the barley, which was a cold and bluish
green, rose Marsworth Church tower to the right.
The reservoirs beyond the turning to Marsworth
were broad and rough-edged, and with some
trimmed poplars at a corner, a straight rank of
trimmed elm trees near the further edge, and the
line of telegraph-wires on this side, they made a
foreign scene, against the background of the Chilterns,
of a fascinating dreariness; one man was fishing
from the bank. Crossing the canal I was in Hertfordshire,
which I left at the far side of the last
reservoir. These dreary waters had attracted some
thickets which the sedge-warbler loved and sang in,
as by the Wilstone Reservoir. The inns (where
they provide for anglers) and the houses near the
locks had the look of canalside and wharfside settlements,
a certain squalor more than redeemed by
the individuality. The unpopulated hills on the
left of it, and the Vale of Aylesbury on the right,
emphasized this half-urban, half-marine character.
The road here was very much broken into sharp
turns not always by a crossing. Immediately after
the last reservoir, before the turning to Drayton
Beauchamp, the road was at its best, winding between
not too level green edges of unequal breadth,
and hedges of thorns and roses and a few ash trees;
and on the edges the grass had been cut and was
lying across the low clover. Doves cooed and a lark<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
overhead sang “as if he never would be old.”
Then, at a bend where a ditch came in and had a
willow above it and some meadow-sweet round about,
a sedge-warbler was singing, the soul of a little
world ten yards across. The crossing of the road
to Drayton was one I shall not forget. The signpost
pointed back to Ivinghoe, forward to Aylesbury,
Buckland, and Aston Clinton, on the right to
Puttenham, on the left to Drayton. There was a
small crook to the left before my road went forward
again. In the midst of the meeting ways the signpost
had a green triangle to stand on. Also, each
road had green borders which all widened to the
crossing; some of the borders had rushes. The
road to Puttenham swelled up a little and fell, and
over the rim showed the trees of the vale. Ahead
and to the left were the wooded downs. As I left
the signpost I had a very sweet, gentle-spoken
“Good morning” from a traveller coming towards
me, a little and rickety dark foreign man, cheerful
and old, carrying a thick satchel on his back and
looking neither to the right nor to the left.</p>

<p>Instead of going on into Akeman Street and then
turning at right angles along it for a mile, I took a
path half a mile on this side of it which led towards
Buckland Church. Where the path crossed the
first hedge, a narrow, low embankment went off to
the left along the hedge, followed by the path
to the church and entering at last an elmy and
nettly lane. Buckland village has many elm trees,
plain little houses, twisting lanes, and a “Buck’s
Head” in a dim corner of them. Its church is of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
alternating flints and freestone, but the tower all of
stone. It was a very cool place with a slow, muffled,
beating clock and a carpet of sun lying across the
floor from the netted open door. One of the tablets
on the wall was to Judith &mdash;&mdash;. High on the wall
under the tower was an inscription <span class="lock">saying:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“Near this place, together with those of an infant
daughter, lie the earthly remains of Frances Russell,
relict of William Russell of Great Missenden, daughter
of Edward and Frances Horwood of this place. She
died October 8, 1793, aged 73 years.</p>

<p>“The fleeting moments of Prosperity, the tedious
hours of Adversity, and the lingering illness which
Providence allotted, she bore with equanimity and
Christian resignation.</p>

<p>“Reader! Go and do likewise.”</p>

<p>It was a rusty and dusty inscription read mostly
by the bellringers standing under the tower, and
one of the most dismal certificates of life, marriage,
motherhood, religion, death and the philosophy of
relatives that I have seen. It was cheerful afterwards
to read the name of Peter Parrot on a tombstone
out in the sun.</p>

</a>
<div class="caption"><p>Aston Clinton.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Past Buckland Church, I turned to the right and
almost at once to the left along a road which went
through a hayfield and then became a borderless
hedged road, but with parallel marks as of traffic
on the left. It came out opposite Aston Clinton
Church into Akeman Street, a main road of elms,
chestnuts, and telegraph-poles, going through
a typical “peaceful” village street, with a smithy
and a “Rose and Crown,” “Swan,” and “Palm in<span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
Hand,” an advertisement of petrol, a horse’s brass
trappings gleaming under a tree, and in the park
on the left hand a peacock proclaiming the neighbourhood
of a large house. I had to turn to the
right along Akeman Street for a quarter mile before
turning out to the left into a road with houses facing
the park. They were poor cottages, a little sordid
and all jammed in a row, and three public houses
amongst them. Past these houses the road was a
dull, straight one under elms, with a clear view over
a level beanfield to the Downs and their trees, with
bright tops and dark, misty shadows below. Presently
a brooklet appeared alongside the road among
willow-herb and overhung by alder, elder, and
willow, and at the beginning of Weston Turville it
provided entertainment for half a hundred ducklings.
The road went through the midst of Weston
Turville and among inns on both sides and down
the turnings, a “Vine,” a “Chequers,” a “Plough,”
a “Six Bells,” a “Black Horse,” a “Chandos,” and
a “Crown,” followed not much beyond the church
by a “Marquis of Granby” and a “Swan”&mdash;but
these were at World’s End. It was a village with
here a house and there two or three round a square
of streets, with the manor-house and elmy church
tower outside it to the south; and between the
houses there were intervals of garden. I noticed
a little house lost between the great bare trunks
of half a forest of trees in a timber merchant’s yard.
I found an inn which had a straight settle facing
a curved one of elm with a sloping back and reasonable
arm-rests. There were quoits on pegs under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
the ceiling, and above the usual circular target for
darts; the open fireplace had a kitchen range placed
in it. The floor was composed of bluish-black and
red tiles alternating.</p>

<p>I did not make certain how the Icknield Way
went through Weston Turville, though a possible
course seemed to turn left on entering the village
and go by Brook Farm and Malthouse Row,
and a little west of the old manor-house and by
the “Vine.” Unless it took some such course,
it could hardly have got to Terrick and Little
Kimble, but must rather have gone straight on
through Stoke Mandeville, Kimblewick, and Owlswick
and into the road now marked “Lower Icknield
Way” at Pitch Green. I went past the
Weston reservoir to World’s End, and then over
the Wendover and Aylesbury road only a mile north
of Wendover, having clearly in view the obelisk on
Coombe Hill, and a little later the towered Ellesborough
Church looking ghostly in the sunlight
under Beacon Hill. The hay was cut on both sides,
and the road wound between broad borders of
thistles and nettles. Near Terrick I saw the first
meadow crane’s-bill of that season and that
country&mdash;the purple flower whose purple is the
emblem of a rich inward burning passion. At the
very edges of the roadside turf the white clover
grew. In the hawthorns a blackbird sang.</p>

<p>Soon I came to Kimble station on the Aylesbury
branch of the Great Western and Great Central
Junction Railway, and some new houses, one of
them named “Beware of the Dogs.” Under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
railway I turned left to Risborough and Longwick,
not right to Hartwell. And now the road settled down
to a fairly straight course for about ten miles, with
meadow-sweet and rose in its low hedges and a view
over the wheat to the Chilterns. It was usually
about a hundred feet lower than the Upper way,
and from one to two miles north of it. It was crossed
by hardly any road more important than itself,
except that from Thame to Princes Risborough.
At this crossing, outside “The Duke of Wellington”
or “Sportsman’s Arms,” a street organ played
“Beside the Seaside” and other national anthems.
Little more than a mile beyond I entered Oxfordshire.
I left the road to see Chinnor Church, half a
mile south, which looks southward on the juniper-dotted
hills skirted by the Upper way. The most
notable thing in the church was an oval tablet near
the screen inscribed with the <span class="lock">words:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="center">
Beneath<br />
lie<br />
the remains of<br />
William Turner<br />
Esq<sup>re</sup><br />
who died 23<sup>rd</sup> March<br />
1797 aged 61<br />
“Here the wicked cease<br />
from troubling and<br />
the weary are<br />
at rest.”<br />
</p>

<p>The word “here” my fancy took quite literally,
and I saw a skeleton cramped behind the tablet
protesting to the living that there, inside the wall,
denuded of flesh and of all organs, nerves, and
desires, a wicked man ceased from troubling and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
a weary one could be at rest; the teeth of the
skeleton shook in their dry sockets as it, now a
hundred and ten years old, uttered those sweet
words: “Here the wicked cease from troubling
and the weary are at rest.” Some of the dead outside
bore formidable monosyllabic names, such as
Wall, Crook, Saw, and Cocks. At the “Royal Oak”
I listened for half an hour to information and complaints
about the heat, which was at the time about
ninety degrees in the shade, and then went out to
make the most of the heat itself, which I could well
do, having myself, as a good critic has pronounced,
an unvarying temperature of about forty-five
degrees (Fahr.).</p>

<p>I left the “Bird in Hand” and a squat, white
windmill on the left and entered a fine green road
going straight south-west. One of the hedges was
high enough for shade, in the other some young
chestnut trees were growing up. After some distance
the left half of the road was rough and had a
ditch along it; then a tiny stream flowed across,
and the way lost its left hedge and went slightly
raised between wheat and oats, poppy and tall,
pale scabious. After that I had clover and bird’s-foot
trefoil and bedstraw and rest-harrow underfoot&mdash;corn
on the left as far as elms in masses, and behind
these the Chilterns&mdash;corn on the right and
ridges of elms beyond. Then another rillet traversed
the road and cooled the feet. In places the
grass was very long. Crossing the road to Kingston
Blount the way was more used and rougher; as before
it had corn on both hands&mdash;barley and oats speckled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
like a partridge. Then a third rillet, and then wheat,
barley, oats, and beans in turn; on the other side
of the way wych-elms. There were always elms,
and here and there a farm under them, beyond the
corn on the left. Aston Rowant lay near on my
left, with a towered church, a big house, and men
upon a rick, at the edge of the elms. To cross the
Aston road my way made a slight crook to the left
and then skirted the hay of Aston Rowant park,
with elms and sweet limes amidst the hay: it was
a good grass and clover track, not deeply rutted.
Presently in the mowed and cleared fields on both
sides cattle were walking out from milking. With
another slight crook to the left the way crossed the
High Wycombe and Stokenchurch and Oxford road,
where yellow-hammers were singing in the beeches
alongside the telegraph-posts. My way was now
a hard road bordered by beeches and firs, through
which I could see the tower of Lewknor Church across
a hayfield. A willow-wren, with a voice like the
sweet voice of someone a thousand years away, was
singing among the tops of the trees. Below, briers
and thorns were interwoven, and silver-weed grew
at the edge of the dust. Some country people say
that silver-weed is good for the feet, a belief which
might well have no better foundation than the
fact that it grows commonly close to the road which
is cruel to the feet. On the right I passed a little
deserted lodge with pointed windows and doorway
gaping blank, and on the left a wood of beech, elm,
and chestnut shadowing a wall in which there was
a door barricaded almost to the lintel by nettles.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
This cool wood was full of the chiding of blackbirds
and one thrush’s singing. Near the end this piece
of road turns decidedly to the left; but over the
wall on the right are some signs of a track which had
not this southward bend. At the end of the present
road, but a little way to the right along the road to
Wheatfield, which it enters, is Moor Court, a small
old house of bricks and tiles, with wings at each
side, and a massive stone chimney at the road end;
and it has a range of thatched farm buildings and a
line of Lombardy poplars all enclosed in a wet moat.
A little farther up, a farm road, which might have
continued the track on the right of the road just
quitted, turns out to the left and with a short break
leads to Pyrton and Cuxham and Brightwell Baldwin
and so to Wallingford; or from Pyrton the route
might be to Watcombe Manor, Britwell, and Ewelme.
But the Lower Icknield Way is, to judge from
the map, supposed to give up its individuality at
Moor Court and make straight away through Lewknor
and by Sheepcote Lane to join the Upper road.
There seems no good reason why this connection
between the two, if it were such, should have been
more than a convenience for a few travellers, unless
we suppose that the very hilly and uneven portion
of the Upper road, between the beginning of the
separation and Chinnor Hill, so frequently became
impassable that it was abandoned for short or long
periods or altogether. But as a road close to
Ewelme was known in the seventeenth century as
the Lower Icknield Way, I was determined to go
by Ewelme. From Moor Court I went down to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
pretty group of a smithy, a “Leather Bottle,” and
Lewknor’s towered church at the crossing, where I
entered the high road, making past Shirburn
Castle to Watlington. At Watlington the road
bends sharp to the right, and so comes into line
with the Lower Icknield Way, as it was near
Moor Court.</p>

<p>This road between the Chilterns and the corn was
followed by a single line of telegraph wire. It had a
slightly raised green edge on the right, marked by
footpaths. It went within a few yards of the
moated castle of Shirburn. Here, says the marvelling
countryside, the drawbridge is nightly drawn
up, presumably with the philanthropic motive of
giving work to somebody. I wished to see the
castle as the home of a library which has lately
given to the world a collection of ballads from manuscript
of the early sixteenth century&mdash;“The Shirburn
Ballads.” But a great length of eight-foot
wall alongside the road shut off the view. It was a
bad wall too, and could not be liked or admired for
its own sake. I succeeded only in seeing one new
battlemented tower, which, I was told, supplied
water for the castle laundry. The best thing at
Shirburn was almost opposite the castle entrance&mdash;a
narrow strip of land raised above the road, and
protected from it by a row of goodly elm trees, so
that I walked between a high hedge and them in
a private coolness and green gloom as of an airy
church about a hundred yards long. On the hedge
side of this strip there was a depression which might
have been the old road: or perhaps at one time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
the elms stood in the middle of the road like those
yonder on the Upper Icknield Way under Watlington
Hill. Hereby they have set up the reputed remains
of one of Queen Eleanor’s funeral crosses.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>Watlington.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Watlington is a big square village of no great
beauty or extraordinary antiquity, all of a piece
and rustic, but urban in its compression of house
against house. A castle stood at the north edge
near the present church. The Oxford road bounds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
the town on its garden side, where farm-houses
begin and cottages with gardens of monkshood and
roses. Near this road there was a “pleasure fair,”
where the roundabouts and swings of some travelling
company were putting in time on their way to a
bigger town and a regular engagement. There must
be great wisdom in the men of Watlington, to be able
to harmonize their grave, rustic streets with the
town-bred music as of a steam-engine in pain. It
was a feat I could not accomplish. The most I could
do was to go into a taproom, where the music did
not penetrate and the weary were at rest. It was
a most beautiful evening, and the swifts were shrieking
low down along the deserted streets at nine
o’clock. I should like to see them crowded with
sheep from Ilsley, and the old drover wearing a
thistle in his cap, or with Welsh ponies going to
Stokenchurch Fair over the Chilterns. But there
is no market at Watlington, and nothing but a
“pleasure” fair; a cheap week-end railway ticket
to London pleases the country people by making
them feel near London, whether they go or not; and
it may encourage new residents. This was what my
host wanted; his taproom was much too peaceful
for living men, though he liked well enough to smoke
his last pipe there, sitting in his shirt sleeves until
the silent room was quite dark and his children
came home from the roundabouts. A man came
heavily down the street wheeling a barrow, stopped
outside and called for a pint; while he waited he
ruminated, looking down the street to the first stars
and whistling “Beside the seaside, beside the sea,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
then he tipped up his tankard, emptied it, and
went off in a determined manner.</p>

<p>When I went up to bed I was astonished to find
a bedroom that was not at all new to me, though I
had never before, to my knowledge, stopped at this
inn. If it was an illusion, the pictures created it.
I had certainly seen them before, in Wales, in Cornwall,
in Wiltshire, and in Kent. What first caught
my eye was a beauteous female of a far from slender
type kneeling unharmed in the midst of roaring
waters. She had on a snowy night-dress, over which
her curls flowed far down in admirable disorder.
The foam of the sea flew all over and round her
without wetting her night-dress or taking the gloss
out of her curls. Her face also seemed unaffected
by her extraordinary position on a small, isolated
rock in the sea, and wore an expression that would
have been better suited to an afflicted lady in her
own apartment. She was suffering, but not from
exposure to cold and wet, and what was more
extraordinary still was, that on this solitary rock
she had found a quantity of thick, velvety stuff, and
on this, as was natural, she was kneeling to save her
tender knees from the unaccustomed rock.</p>

<p>On the opposite wall hung a similar picture, I
suppose by the same artist, for surely there could
be only one man who had these marvellous visions&mdash;visions
they must have been, since no one could
invent things so improbable and, without their
visionary character, so ridiculous. Here also the
scene was a wild sea and a rock in the midst. One
beauteous girl of the same type as in the other pic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>ture
was in the water, another had apparently just
clambered up on to the rock. I say apparently, but
her night-dress was dry, snow-white, and untorn.
I say apparently, because I could only imagine that
the two had been swimming together and one had
got first to the rock; for it was not likely that one
should find herself on a rock in this position and
then by mere chance see a fellow-mortal of the same
sex, age, beauty, and costume struggling with the
waves close by. Her struggle was nearly over, for
the beauty on the rock, kneeling on the velvet carpet
which, by a fortunate accident, almost covered
it, bent over in an attitude of much grace and caught
her unhappy sister by one of her fair hands. The
face of the swimmer was upturned and exquisitely
sad, but, as in the other picture, it was not the
sadness of a swimmer in stormy and dark waters,
but rather of a lady inwardly tormented by some
difficulty of the “heart” or of the “spirit,” to use
a popular physiology. Her sadness was great, and
naturally so; but I should have expected to see
astonishment mingled with it, because what could
be seen of her night-dress was dry as it had ever been
in the linen cupboard at her stately home; and her
hair, though loose, was not untidy and would have
pleased a lover, had she confessed one and had he,
instead of another lady, been aiding her in distress.
I had last seen these two pictures at Tregaron, and
I sighed with a serene and pleasant recollection of
the place, the season, and the company.</p>

<p>I was glad also to see a third work of the same
artist, or at least of the same school. It belonged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
to a different period, geological rather than marine;
and again it must be insisted that the work was
visionary because no one capable of a mere invention
so ridiculous is likely to have the power and
the patience to execute it with such completeness
and finish. The scene was midnight in a valley of
rocks and of high, precipitous, rocky sides, wide
enough apart to have admitted a mountain torrent
of some size. But it was dry, and over the sharp
rocks went a most beautiful lady. She was dressed
in thin and clinging garments from her shoulders
down to her ankles. To meet a woman so beautiful
and so suitably and yet unusually dressed all alone
in the mountains would be at least as surprising
as to see her on a little rock in the sea as one was
passing in a storm. I could imagine her easily upon
the velvet-covered rock. Her arms were bare, and
with one she clasped a book to her left breast, while
with the other she felt her way along the precipitous
wall of the valley and steadied herself over the cruel
rocks. It was to be noticed that there was no
velvet over these rocks, and this is another proof
of the genuineness of the artist’s vision, unless it
should be suspected that he disliked the appearance
of a long strip of carpet all down a valley. A fierce
and extravagant vision, you will say. But the
gentleness which had somehow ensured the carpet
in the marine vision had not been eclipsed in the
geological. From the edge of the farther wall of
the valley shone a light. Someone was up there
with a lantern and was turning its beams down on
to the spot under the fair traveller’s feet. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
could be little doubt that he was following her
along with the light, but he could not be seen. The
lantern would have been more <em>natural</em> in a narrow
alley in a town, but there was no question here of
mere nature. If it comes to nature, was there ever
a period when a woman of such beauty, and of very
great refinement, strayed out with a book among
inhospitable mountains, clad in a dress that was
fitted rather to suggest and even display the form
of limbs and bosom than to protect them from rocks,
thorns, and weather, not to speak of men and other
wild beasts? A voluptuous Oriental or Frenchman
might of course sit down and invent an earthly
paradise with a small population of like beauties,
but their object would be as unmistakable as it
would be objectionable to persons of sensibility and
discipline, except when alone or off their guard.
But an Englishman or a German could only have
copied such a picture from a vision having nothing
to do with the flesh, and a charge of any
such thing would recoil upon the accuser. I
believe it was by an Englishman or a German. I
should like to see some of the work of his less
visionary moods. I should like to see him with his
family, talking to his wife about the butcher’s bill
and his daughter’s marriage&mdash;I should like to know
if he had a daughter or a child at all. I should like
to see him with his friends after dinner, and reading
Mr. George Moore’s <cite>Memoirs of my Dead Life</cite>.</p>

<p>I thought at one time that one of the other pictures
was by the same man, partly because it is
so often to be seen with his work and appeals to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
the same people, such as myself, and partly because
it had a similar detachment from modern life; but
I could not feel sure that it was the result of a vision
and not of pure invention. The scene was a summer
garden sloping down to a river, and at the foot of
the slope a terrace of turf and a flight of steps to
the water. On the terrace four girls were having
tea. They were much thinner than those on the
rocks; they wore white clinging dresses and their
heads were bare. They were all smiling and their
faces were such that no man could imagine a
god, providence, fate, parent, lover, doctor or
little boy in the street hard-hearted enough to
interrupt the smiles. Human beings like them are
not to be seen now, and no portraits or records of
them in the past have come down to us. They
seemed born to eat chocolate and drink sweet
lemonade and never suffer from the consequences.
There had been five of them, but one stood on the
bottom step feeding two swans without any apparent
effort. She had a hat in her hand either because
a hat is more beautiful than a hand or because
it is more easy to draw. She was hanging down her
head thinking of something&mdash;or it might be nothing&mdash;unconnected
with the swans or the slow, still
river. Behind her a person whose mouth would not
melt butter stood looking at her back. He was
dressed in pretty breeches and buckled shoes, and
was interesting chiefly as making the observer
marvel what witty power had added a creature
so appropriate to such a company. As marvellous
must have been the artist’s invention. If it could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
be imagined that dresses should, out of their own
spirit, magically produce beings to wear them they
would be like these five ladies; and if dainty
breeches, silk stockings, and buckled shoes should
have the same power they would unfold a man like
the lover. The effect of the whole was to suggest
summer, a lovely and harmless place (for the artist’s
fresh water would not drown, any more than his
sea water would wet a night-dress), wealth, luxury,
happiness, youth, frivolity, innocence, benevolence&mdash;to
suggest them, especially to those who know very
little of these things.</p>

<p>There were several pictures of scenery. One
showed a steep and very romantic forest road. It
was deep in snow, and enormous trees, whose roots
were nourished in Hades, towered up above on either
hand, but let in the light of a full moon that shone
straight down the road. Towards the moon and
up the road went a tall, mantled traveller, leaning on
a staff and turning his head to look into the wood.
The picture had no name, text, or explanation. It
was a nameless man and a nameless traveller, both
unknown to history. Nothing was happening. It
was simply a combination of four or five grand,
simple elements; a mighty forest&mdash;a moon&mdash;snow&mdash;a
solitary road&mdash;a tall traveller.</p>

<p>One of the other pictures was the same, except
that a foaming river took the place of the snowy
road. The forest and the moon were the same.
The traveller was not there, and to one who had
seen the last picture there was a touch of tragedy
in his absence which atoned for it; he might have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
been surprised at the very moment when the snowy
road was being changed into a foaming river. Those
who had not seen the other had to be content with
a moon, a romantic forest, a river running down
through it, and foam instead of snow. It hardly
seemed to me to be enough&mdash;lacking the human
interest. A small flock of sheep among the trees,
with or even without a shepherd, would have made
a vital difference, and the picture could then also
have been recognized by purchasers and recipients
of Christmas cards. And this picture was one which
would appeal to those who knew the kind of thing
depicted. Rough woodlanders and their wives,
people who have suffered in snow, poor men who
have travelled alone and leaned on their staffs,
would gladly put both pictures on their walls. There
were photographs of such people on the mantelpiece,
people whom no best clothes or photographer’s
polish could turn into poetic heroes or cigar-box
beauties; men with queer hairy faces, legs bent
like oak branches, and eyes squinting at the photographer;
women their equals, but if anything more
hardened, more tortured, more smiling upon the
occasion of being photographed.</p>

<p>Between photographs of a gamekeeper, whose
face was like a furze bush with eyes in it, and a
card of mourning for Jane Mary Sims, aged seventy-three,
hung a picture seeming to have little to do
with either. It was of a high-born and well-dressed
lady with regular features and graceful, mature
figure sitting beside a cradled child. She was bending
over towards the child, and her face, though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
composed, was sorrowful. Had she looked up she
would have seen an unusual sight, and it was a
mercy that she did not, for it would have certainly
upset her composure through astonishment and
fear. For not many feet from her was the head of
a human being who was coming towards her head
foremost through the window, or more probably
the ceiling. I say a human being because her body&mdash;it
was a mature and athletic, slender lady&mdash;was
of the same general form, size, and proportions as
those of our own species, and she wore the clinging
night-dress so much favoured by the visionary
artist. But she had wings attached to her shoulders,
not large enough to be of any use, supposing her to
have learned their management, but sufficient to
make part of a becoming fancy dress or fairy dancing
costume. She had apparently dived from some
height, and in a bewitching attitude was making
straight for the cradle. As she was no Ariel’s sister
capable of playing “i’ th’ plighted clouds,” the
danger both to her and to the cradle was great.
She faced it with no sign of fear, her soft eyes and
her even and not too full lips expressing a mind in
tranquillity and scarcely, if at all, stirred by expectation
or surmise. There was no sequel to this daring
but painful picture, nor, of course, any explanation.
It was, I should say, the fancy of a genius who had
mingled the common and the improbable in dreams
produced by opium or other drug.</p>

<span class="smaller">SIXTH DAY&mdash;WATLINGTON TO UPTON, BY EWELME,
WALLINGFORD, LITTLE STOKE, THE PAPIST WAY,
LOLLINGDON, ASTON, AND BLEWBURY</span></h2>
</div>


<p>For supper, bed, and picture gallery my host
at Watlington charged me two shillings, and called
me at five into the bargain, as I wished to breakfast
at Wallingford. I took the turning to Ewelme
out of the Oxford road, and was soon high up among
large, low-hedged fields of undulating arable, with
here and there a mass or a troop of elms at a corner,
above a farm, or down a hedge. Farther away on
the left I had the Chilterns, wooded on their crests
and in their hollows, not very high, but shapely.
The sky was misted at the horizon, but overhead
milky blue, with thin-spun, dim white cloud; the sun
a burning disc; half-way up the sky hung heavier
white clouds, which might develop later. The road
was clover-edged, winding, and undulating, and by
no means an improbable connection of the Icknield
Way. Britwell Salome Church lay on my right,
across a willowy field, and having no tower or spire,
it was like one of the farm buildings surrounding
it. Then my road mounted between nettly and
elmy banks, and had a bit of waste on the right
where chalk had been dug&mdash;a pretty tumbled piece,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
all nettles and gix and white bryony under ash
trees. There was not much hedge between the road
and the corn before I got to the “Plough” at
Britwell Salome, and next the “Sun.” The village
was scattered among trees, not interrupting the
smell of hay. The road skirted it, and was soon
out again amongst the wheat, and passing Britwell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
park, where the cattle were crossing in a straight
line between groups of elms. In the hedge there
was bracken along with the yellow bedstraw and
white bryony. For a time there were gorse and
bracken together on the green strip above the road.
Then, instead of going straight on to Benson, I
turned to the left for Firebrass Hill, Ewelme, and
Wallingford. Beyond this turn all the country
round was high, bare cornland undulating to the
darker hills. The road had nettles for a hedge, or
sometimes brier, scabious, knap-weed, and rest-harrow,
and once some more purple meadow crane’s-bill;
it had steep banks, but no green border. But
this was not the Icknield Way, which would never
have dipped down to the lower part of Ewelme
and up again at once. The first houses of the
village were decent, small ones, standing high and
looking down at the farm-house thatch, the cottages,
gardens of fruit trees, and elms of the main village.
The churchyard covered the slope down from the
upper to the lower village, and in the midst stood
the church, a venerable one with a particularly
neat growth of ivy across the tower. I could not
get into the church, but could hear the clock
ticking in the emptiness. In the churchyard I
noticed this devout fancy over the body of Alice
Heath, who died in <span class="lock">1776:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>I should like to know what was in the verse-writer’s
mind when he penned the first line. The word<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
“surprise” pleased me most, though due to a
rhyme. It occurred to me that the writer’s mind,
through grief, might have been in the same condition
as the bedroom artist at Watlington who drew the
lady and the cradle and the beautiful winged diver.
I believe that this artist would have translated
literally into pictorial form the <span class="lock">words:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">

<p>He would have shown a neat, grassy churchyard
with an immemorial church tower in the background.
Scattered over the turf close to the
church would be an indistinct crowd of tombstones.
Nearer and clearer he would present a new
and costly stone, probably in the form of a cross,
standing at the top of three or four steps. Many
wreaths of rare and costly flowers would lie unfaded
at the foot of the steps. On the lowest step two
figures of exceptional beauty and dignity would
be kneeling without sign of impatience or any
other emotion. They would be in the customary
costume of these pictures, and the onlooker would
marvel what they were doing; and if he knew that
they were watching the dust below, he would still
conjecture as to what they were to watch against,
and how they proposed to resist the attempts
of any robbing man, beast, dragon, or other monster.
But it is unlikely that any such picture was in the
mind of the Ewelme epitaph-writer. He or she
had perhaps no distinct image; choosing words
that would fit the metre and not be in any way
surprising to the religious, he thought of “angels”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
and of “dust,” and the need of epithets pretty
soon suggested “kind” and “sleeping.” Nevertheless,
when I read it I came so near to forming an
image, rather in the style of the bedroom artist,
that it is possible the writer had an image or vision
of some sort, and handed it on to me in that early
July morning before anyone was on the roads or
in the churchyard.</p>

<p>There was a much better stone and delicately
writ inscription near the east window. The stone,
a very thin, shouldered one, had slipped down into

<p>Here the smallness and prettiness of the thin stone,
its being half swallowed up in earth and grass, the
fineness of the written, not printed, lettering, the
name a poem in itself and half Welsh, the youth of
the girl, her death in April more than two hundred
years ago, all together produced an effect like that
of beauty, nay! which was beauty. Not far off
was a ponderous square chest with as much reading
on it as a page of newspaper, dated 1869. The
sparrows were chittering in the elms.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>Ewelme Cow Common.</p></div>
</div>

<p>My road dipped down through the village, and
to the left by the “Greyhound” and up between
steep banks under larch trees. On the right a few
yards up that road a footpath used to go for two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
miles towards Wallingford, but it was covered by
corn for the first part, and I kept to the road.
I was soon going past the Ewelme cow common
again, but along the opposite side; and there were
cows among its thorns. For a few yards, after crossing
the Benson and Dorchester road at Gypsies’
Corner, I was in the Upper Icknield Way again,
but turned to the right, due west, leaving Clack’s
Farm on the south instead of the west. I was
then going down towards the green-striped cornland,
the clustered trees of the Thames Valley,
and the pale spire and tower of Wallingford rising
out of it. The low, long curves of land meeting
or intersecting a little above the river were like
those of a brier with nothing to climb. In the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
hedges there were wild roses and masses of traveller’s
joy, with all its grey-green buds very large. Instead
of following the road round its bend to the south-west,
I turned just past the bend into a green
lane to the right, which made straight for Wallingford
spire; and into this lane presently came the footpath
from Ewelme and a parallel old lane. However,
I had to turn sharp to the left to reach Crowmarsh
Gifford and Wallingford. Crowmarsh is a
wide street of old cottages leading to Wallingford
bridge. Wallingford climbs the right bank up from
the bridge, and out of its crowded brick rise the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
tower and the spire of two churches, and the ivied
tower of a castle, of the kind that looks as if it had
been ready-made ruinous and ivied, with a flagstaff
on top. I crossed the bridge to the town, and
went up the narrow, old street, past an inn called
“The Shakespeare,” to the small square of small
shops, where red and blue implements of farming
stood by the pillared town hall and the sun poured
on them. I went into the “private bar” of an
inn, but hearing only a blue-bottle and seeing little
but a polished table, and smelling nothing else,
I went out and round the corner to the taproom
of the same inn. Here there were men, politics,
crops, beer, and shag tobacco.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 550px;">

</a>
<div class="caption"><p>Wallingford Bridge.</p></div>
</div>

<p>This contrast between the “private bar” and
the taproom round the corner reminded me of
another town which illustrates it perfectly. At
the edge of the town, its large front windows
looking up the principal street, its small back
windows over a windy common to noble hills,
is a public house called “The Jolly Drover.”
The tap of “The Jolly Drover” is the one blot
upon the face of Coldiston. The town is clean
and demure from the decent old houses of the
market-place to the brand-new cottages, more
like conservatories than dwellings, on the outskirts.
The magistrates are busy week after week
in sentencing men and women of all ages for begging,
asking for hot water to make tea, sleeping under
hedges or in barns, for being unseemly in act or
speech; if possible, nothing offensive must happen
in the streets. A market is held once a week and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
is a byword in the county. Any animal can be
offered for sale there; the drover creeps along
behind a beast that attracts as much attention as
a menagerie in the wayside villages; they know
where it is going; they have seen a pig resembling
a greyhound, except that it had not the strength
to stand up, sold there for a shilling. Three or
four times a year a builder and contractor of
Coldiston is sold up, because he has been trying
to get work by doing it for nothing, and these sales
are the chief diversion of the neighbourhood.
The town is a model of neatness and respectability,
as if created by a shop-window decorator; and of
all the public-houses&mdash;all named hotels&mdash;“The
Jolly Drover” is the neatest and most respectable
outside, and the most expensive inside. It is painted
white at short intervals. The chief barmaid is
a Londoner, white-faced and coral-lipped, with
a love-lock over her marble brow; and her way
is brisk and knowing, and her speech more than
equal to the demands made upon it of an evening
by the tradesmen who will come until they are
rich enough to quit the town for ever. Every form
of invitation adorns the exterior.</p>

<p>But round the corner, towards the common,
“The Jolly Drover” is white no longer. It has no
pavement outside, but a space of bare earth overshadowed
by an enormous elm’s last two living
branches and roughened by its wide-spreading
roots. There is no invitation to enter here, but
simply the words upon a low lamp, “The Jolly
Drover Tap.” No invitation is needed, for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
windows are not curtained and the passer-by cannot
fail to see the contented backs of drinkers and the
long tiers of bottles. At night almost as much can
be seen through the yellow blinds. The door stands
open opposite the old tree, and through it the eye
finds the bar, the plain country barmaid, the lamp,
and the bright bottles. A mongrel dog or two
and a gypsy’s broken-down cart and wild-eyed
horse are usually outside, or a tramp’s woman
waiting, or a group of men talking quietly before
going in or after coming out. Here “The Jolly
Drover” answers to its name. It is a hedge public
house of old red brick and tiles, joined, nevertheless,
to the white-fronted hotel and connected with it
in the proprietor’s accounts. It is noisy. They sing
there. No plain man is afraid to go in who has the
price of half a pint in his pocket. In the summer
benches are set outside, and men can sit and see
the discreet going to and fro of the town life a few
yards away.</p>

<p>Old Jack Runaway (who will borrow sixpence
and then lose half a year’s custom in watercress
for fear of showing his face again) has lost six
heifers that he was taking to the fair over the hill,
but he has a pint inside and a pint before him&mdash;the
clock stands still&mdash;and as the people go by he
comments to <span class="lock">himself:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“My young Lord Drapery, may he go to gaol
for being a poor beggar before he’s forty. A brood
mare; what with living between a policeman and a
postman, with a registrar in front and a minister
behind, <em>her</em> children ought to be tin soldiers. Now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
I wonder what’s <em>he</em> worth? But if I was coined
into golden sovereigns I wouldn’t have married
his missus when I was twenty, no, I wouldn’t.
Pretty Miss Ladybird, Ladybird, Ladybird, fly
away from home; you’re a tantalizer for a fine
day, to be out with a young chap drinking a glass
of six and nobody looking. What we do lose by
being old, to be sure, more than by being poor!
What a clean, white beard, now, that Mr. Welcome
has got, like an angel. Eh, old Colonel High and
Mighty, there’s doctors for sciatica and gout,
but there’s something we have both got by being
sixty that they won’t cure, not if your purse is as
long as your two legs. How much do <em>you</em> weigh,
bombarrel? They don’t allow a carriage and pair
in Kingdom Come. Now, <em>that</em> young fellow could
break a good few stones on a summer’s day; kind,
too, and don’t his heels kick the pavement
proud; but mind the women don’t bend your back
for you, or you might as well be dust to dust any
day. That’s what I call a good piece, neat and not
too stuck up, not so young as she was, keeps the
house tidy, and knows where they sell the best
things cheap; now, I’d like to walk into your parlour
and have a cup of tea, missus, after wiping my feet
on the mat and hanging up my hat; and then that
little ladybird of a nursemaid brings in the baby,
and we feed it on cake and weak tea; it must be
weak, or it’s bad for the health ...; and wouldn’t
I be proud to have you brushing my coat as I goes
out of a morning, a black coat, and putting a rose
in my button-hole, and kissing me before all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
street&mdash;ha, ha! dirty Jack Runaway. How they
do dress up the youngsters these days, like little
angels; hark at them talking, and when the mother
whispers to them and they run over as if you dropped
it and give you a penny, you might think it would
turn into a flower in their hands, and they give you
a kind of look as much as to say, ‘God is feeding
His sparrows,’ and then they run away without
a word, and you look at the price of half a pint,
and either you bless them or else you curse them.
<em>You</em>, Reverend Sir, would give me a cold in the
head if you were to talk; then you’d give me sixpence;
if you go to heaven, there’s a bit of luck
left for those who don’t, you freezing point, you
Monday’s loaf, you black-and-white undertaker’s
friend. Oh, this town! it’s rotten without stinking,
gilt without gingerbread. Look at them staring at
us as if we were wild beasts taking an airing <em>outside</em>
the cage....”</p>

<p>The town in its turn does watch “The Jolly
Drover Tap” and its life. Why should there be
all that space wasted where the elm stands? people
wonder; it is quite old-fashioned, and they smile
pityingly, yet tenderly, when the old tree is crowding
into leaf. But when there are half a dozen rough
men and women talking aloud and gesticulating
like foreigners over the price of a long, brown dog
that shivers under a cart, they do not see why it
should be so; only, it is “The Jolly Drover,” and
rather difficult to attack. It is extraordinary,
they think as they pass by the turning down to the
Tap, how a lot of lazy fellows, with nothing to do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
and with only rags on them, can get enough to
spend half a day there. That ought certainly not
to be allowed. These are not the honest poor.
Either a man must work, or be looking out for work
in a serious manner, or be so well dressed that he
obviously need not work; or something is wrong.
Nor do they invariably look starved and miserable.
They eat and drink and talk to one another. Where
do they come from? Of course they do not live
in Coldiston: then why come here to drink?
They cannot, of course, be stuffed into prison or
workhouse or asylum; but is there no other cesspool
possible in an age with a genius for sanitation?</p>

<p>When the blinds are down and the lamp lit,
what a jolly place it is! The light pours out through
the door on to the old tree, and makes it look
friendly as you go in, and romantic as you come out.
It is best at haymaking or harvest time in fine
weather. The irregular labourers come into the
town, especially on a Saturday, and break their
journey at “The Jolly Drover Tap.” The townsman
glances in as he passes, and sees a tall, straight
man in a restful attitude standing up at the bar,
and he has just raised his pot to drink. It is only
a glimpse of a second, but it remains in the mind.
The passer-by could not say how the drinker was
clad, except that he wore a loose, broad-brimmed
hat on his head, pushed back so as to leave quite
clear against the lamp the whole of a big-featured,
long face, the brow, and the curled hair up to the
crown. Was it coat and trousers, or just shirt and
trousers? At any rate the whole man could be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
seen underneath. Not that the observer did not
as a rule admire a man fully and fashionably
dressed. Only, in this light, just this harvest
evening of purple and of great silence, the tall
man drinking with head thrown back at the end
of the passage looked more like the statues of a bygone
age, or the representations of magnificent men
seen in pictures, or the soldiers he has read of in books
about the wars of Roundhead and Cavalier or the
invasions of Wales and Scotland&mdash;yes! the height
and carriage of this man call up the words “rough
borderer.” A lance or a long sword would look well
in his hands. His hat is not unlike a foot-soldier’s
helmet. And then the face&mdash;coarse, fearless, and
careless&mdash;is an enigma. He is some fellow without
a house, or wife, or any goods or gods, yet this is how
the admirer used to picture lords and generals when
a little boy at school. He is not thinking about
rent, accounts, education, clothes, the poor, church,
chapel, appendicitis, or this time next year. He is
not apparently in a hurry. He has no vote, and one
party in power is as good as the other to him.
No doubt a wasteful fellow&mdash;has fallen, perhaps,
through drink&mdash;is good-natured possibly, but would
not stop short at violence on occasion&mdash;idle with
all his strength&mdash;and yet.... And yet? The
figure and face against the light stick in the mind
of the man out in the street. He is discontented.
He grumbles at his wife when he goes in because
she has not done something, and he does more, he
grows enraged, when he finds that she really has
done it, but has not had time to tell him. He lies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
still in bed on his back, thinking for a long time.
His wife lies still, and he knows that she also is
awake thinking. He says “Good night,” hoping
she will say something to comfort him for his
fruitless wakefulness. But she says “Good night,”
and no more. They remain silent. He has the
image of the drinker clear in the darkness before
he falls asleep. Left entirely alone his wife sighs,
and presently she also is asleep.</p>

<p>But I do not wish to say that Wallingford is as
respectable as Coldiston. All I can say is that the
ford below is very old, and it is highly probable that
some travellers on the Icknield Way followed the
road I had been on from Gypsies’ Corner to Wallingford
and then into the Berkshire Ickleton Street
at Blewbury, if not before. Others, avoiding
Wallingford, might have crossed at Little Stoke,
from which a westward road goes up, called the
“Papist Way.”</p>

<p>From Wallingford I made for the “Papist Way,”
following a series of paths and roads about a quarter
of a mile east of the river. I went past the little
towerless and spireless church of Newnham Murren,
which had a number of crooked, ivy-coloured tombstones,
and was itself covered with ivy, which
traveller’s joy was beginning to climb. Then over
Grim’s Ditch, a mile and a half west of the Icknield
Way crossing, I came to Mongewell park, and my
path was along a line of huge elms and sweet limes.
On my left, the main road and its telegraph
wires ran bordered with charlock along the top of
a low ridge above these meadows. From North<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
Stoke there was a good road. I turned aside to the
church, but found what was better, a big range of
tiled, thatched sheds and barns extending on either
side of my path, with a cattle-yard in the midst full
of dazzling straw and richly-stinking cow dung,
and a big black sow lying on it like a recumbent
statue on a huge pedestal. Swifts were shrieking
above and chickens clucking in the corners. From
the road the tiled church and the thatched barn
fell into line, and seemed one, especially as the farm
pigeons were perched on the ridges of both. On
a corn-rick behind I saw the figure of a sheep on
a weather-vane. This road went alongside hedgeless
barley on the left, over which I could see the
bare, low hills between me and the Icknield Way,
and far beyond them the wooded hills about Nuffield
and Nettlebed; on the right there was hay to the
river; there was succory on the roadside, scabious,
knapweed, rest-harrow, and long grass.</p>

<p>To reach the ferry at Little Stoke I turned off
to the right under elm trees and was rowed across.
The boy told me that the road up from the ferry
was called Asylum Road, there being a big, red
lunatic asylum on the right-hand side of it, just
as it crossed the Reading and Wallingford road.
Only beyond this crossing is it marked “Papist
Way” on the map. I have not discovered why it
was named so, for the name suggests too late a
date to be connected with the monastery which lay
near where the road reaches the Great Western railway
station at Cholsey. It points to the Astons, Blewbury,
and Upton, and may at one time have formed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
part of a road running through them to Wantage;
unless this road is rather a protraction of the road
from South Stoke and Moulsford, which may, however,
have joined the “Papist Way” at Lollingdon.</p>

<p>They were talking about roads at the “Morning
Star” on the left side of the “Papist Way.” The
fat drayman and the smart butcher’s boy agreed
that motor-cars were ruining the good roads. The
rubber wheels can travel on the smoothest possible
surface, which is the modern ideal. Hoofs, on the
other hand, need something to bite into. The
drayman, with his heavy waggon, would do away
with steam-rollers. Here the needy cyclist interrupted,
and said that he had never known better
times; the smooth roads were as good for him as
for motor-cars. All cursed their dust, their stink,
their insolence, and all looked with some admiration
at the foreign-looking chauffeur who came in for a
glass and out again in a minute. Outside, the flies
were “terrifying” the horses for the first time in
the summer, and the drivers inside yelled at them,
but seldom moved from their beer. One driver
was a man with big, red ears, and a serious, quizzical
face, with a beard. He came in wearing a fine musk
thistle, which he seemed to think was Scotch,
but immediately on being given a bunch of sweet
peas he threw it away. If this had been his preference
it would have been absurd enough&mdash;as if a
musk thistle were not better than all the sweet
peas ever contrived by man and God!&mdash;but he took
the garden flowers because they were things having
a price, and because they were a gift.</p>

</a>
<div class="caption"><p>By Lollingdon Farm.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The “Papist Way” was a hard road winding
between wheat and beans for half a mile. Then
it crossed the Wallingford and Cholsey road, and
was interrupted by the railway embankment.
Its course on the farther side of this seemed
to be marked by a division between barley and
potatoes to the left of the present road. This line<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
was continued through Pancroft farm-yard, from
which a path went south-westward along the
hedges to Lollingdon. This was over black, rushy
lands haunted by pewits. The road a little on the
left, leading also to Lollingdon Farm, was on better
ground, winding westward under the wooded swell
of the round hill called Lollingdon Hill. The farm
had a big home meadow with ash and poplar enclosing
it, almost as if it had been a quadrangle with
cloisters round. There were many thatched farm
buildings in the corner, and a fine walnut tree and
a beautiful abundance of poppies and dusty nettle
and dusty mallow against the walls. The road
had an elmy hedge on its right, but nothing on the
left between it and the oats that reached up to the
beeches of Lollingdon Hill-top. The long grass and
knapweed and succory by the roadside were blossoming
with white and meadow-brown butterflies,
which flew away from their stalks as ducklings
swim away from their unamphibious foster-mothers.
The butterflies flew after one another,
sometimes a white after a brown. The sun was perfect
for them, there being fewer clouds than there
were eight hours back&mdash;for as I walked I heard a
pleasant, gong-like bell strike two at Aston.</p>

<p>Aston Tirrold and Aston Upthorpe make a
square of roads with many lanes and paths
crossing from one side to another. In the square
are big houses and small, and their gardens and old,
nettly orchards, and many sycamores, elms, chestnuts,
and acacias in the gardens and along the
paths; there are even some small fields within it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
Running water goes through it. Here you pass
a mud wall, there a hedge, here a boarded, there a
thatched, and again a tiled, cottage. At some of
the corners and in the churchyard stand lime trees.
If a happy child had all the ingredients of old villages
to play with, it would, if it were ingenious, probably
combine them thus. The farms are all outside the
square but close to it. The churches are near the
edge but within it. I hardly believed that anybody
remained alive in the village until I failed to open
the door of Aston Tirrold Church. Aston Upthorpe
church was a small tiled building with a stupid
little spire stuck on yesterday, to show that it was
not part of the neighbouring tiled farm and outhouses.
The village hid itself well on both sides
under its elms. From the east it seemed all trees
and orchards, from the west only the new thatch
of a rick betrayed it.</p>

<p>My road led along the south side of the village
and commanded a simple, perfect piece of downland&mdash;a
bare, even wall of down with an almost straight
ridge, which was also bare but for one clump;
along the foot of the wall ran the main road to
Wantage; up from it, an old trackway, very
deeply worn, rose slanting and showing one old
steep green bank, up to the ridge and over; and at
the point where the trackway crossed the main
road the turf was carved by a chalk-pit.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 550px;">

</a>
<div class="caption"><p>Blewbury.</p></div>
</div>

<p>A broad track and several parallel paths went
fairly straight without hedges, westward through the
corn to Blewbury, passing close under the south
side of a bare, sudden hill&mdash;Blewburton Hill&mdash;and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
the ramparts of a supposed Danish camp. Blewbury
was like Aston, with a streamlet, many trees and
orchards, and a towered church standing in the midst
of several paths and roads. The clock was beating
slowly with such gigantic and ancient peace inside
the church that I did not enter. It was as if some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
hoary giant were sleeping inside away from the sun,
if indeed he had not been there for some centuries.
Outside the church lay a dilapidated and weed-grown
pair of prostrate effigies. If it were not disturbing
the sleeper in Blewbury Church I should
suggest that these effigies might be taken in. They
are much to be preferred to the clean effigies which
have never borne the weather of God or the
pocket-knives of men; but if they are left outside
much longer they will hardly pass as representations
of two human beings lying on their
backs.</p>

<p>The south side of Blewbury touched the main
Reading and Wantage road, and had several inns:
a “Barley Mow,” a “Catherine Wheel,” a “George
and Dragon,” a “Sawyer’s Arms,” a “Load of
Mischief,” and at its west end a “New Inn.” I
was glad to see that the “Load of Mischief” still
upheld its sign and name. I feared that it might
have been renamed “The Red Lion” or the
“Crown,” and have been robbed of its sign. But
there was the sign, and almost opposite a window,
where I was equally glad and surprised to see an
advertisement of “Votes for Women.” The “Load
of Mischief” was a woman, of a type belonging to
a day hardly later than Hogarth’s, mounted on
the shoulders of a man. The man was a mere small
beast of burden. The woman was magnificent&mdash;a
huge, lusty, brown virago&mdash;and she was holding
in her hand a glass clearly labelled “<span class="smcap">Gin</span>.” This
woman and her ill-chosen spouse were painted on
both sides of the sign-board, so that all coming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
from north and from south should see it. I forgot
to inquire whether “The Load of Mischief” was
a fully licensed house and sold gin. Probably
it was. The sign was not a beerhouse’s defamation
of gin. It did not deny that gin was a very good
thing. It did not assert anything more than that
a big, gin-drinking woman on a small man’s shoulders
was a “load of mischief.” How impossible it is&mdash;even
in this sporting country&mdash;to think of a sign
depicting a big, gin-drinking man on a little woman’s
shoulders. No woman ever painted a sign-board,
I suppose, and no woman keeping an inn would
put up such a one as “The Load of Mischief.” A
woman who drank gin was a load of mischief.
On the other hand, a man who made the gin for
her, provided that he grew rich on it, became a
justice of the peace or a member of Parliament;
if his father made it he became a bishop. It is the
difference between mind and matter, between
brain-work and manual labour. The member of
Parliament or the bishop’s father had only to think
about gin; he might never have tasted it. The
woman had to swallow it and pay for it. Therefore
she grew poor while he grew rich. A history
of England was once written entirely to show this
difference, to insist upon it, and to teach the consumer
that he must never forget his duties and
responsibilities to the manufacturer, and to remind
the manufacturer of his privileges. It was called
“A History of England for Shoe-Blacks and Sons
of Gentlemen: or, A Guide to Tuft-hunting, Sycophancy,
Boot-licking, and other Services to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
Aristocracy and Plutocracy, and to Keeping in
Your Place.” It was published in 1911, and is
used in schools.</p>

<p>When I went into one of the inns there was a
woman seated in the taproom drinking beer,
a shrill and lean, large-eyed woman of middle age,
somewhat in liquor, and with ill-fitting boots, in
which she had walked fifteen miles and had nine
still to do. Whether or not because he had drunk
more, her husband had gone on by train; she said
she had “sent him.” She foresaw that it was not
going to rain that day. She claimed no credit
for the foresight. Her corns alone had the power.
In about a quarter of an hour she left. She was
a woman that walked fast but stopped often.
She carried her hands in the pockets of her black
skirt. Not long after she had started the rain
fell down upon her, as it did upon the roofs, mackintoshes,
and umbrellas of the brewers, publicans,
and brewery shareholders.</p>

<p>From the west of Blewbury to Upton there was
another mile of broad, green tracks through corn,
without a tree between them and the round, smooth
downs, with their tumuli clear against the sky on
the left hand. At Upton this series of roads from
Little Stoke entered the main road, or crossed it,
and continued without touching any villages on
the way to Lockinge and Wantage. But this
further road was a continuation of the line of the
main road before it turned north to Upton and
west to Hagbourne, and might have been an
alternative course to Wantage, or part of an earlier<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
way, perhaps the Icknield Way itself, which some
have supposed to go nearer the Downs than the main
road now does. As I meant at another time to
travel this road and its parallels from Streatley to
the Wiltshire border, I returned to Blewbury, and
at one of the six inns read James Montgomery’s
<cite>Pelican Island</cite>, a poem of <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 1827, in nine
cantos. The poem seemed to have been started and
carried on under the influence of an ecstasy given
to the author by an explorer’s book. In his <cite>Voyage
to Terra Australis</cite>, then not long published, Captain
Matthew Flinders had described two little
islands, the breeding-place and antique cemetery
of pelicans, “islets of a hidden lagoon of an uninhabited
island, situate upon an unknown coast,
near the antipodes of Europe.” This evidently
impressed Montgomery with a strong feeling of
solitariness. He imagined himself alone when
“sky, sun, and sea were all the universe,” himself
a spirit, “all eye, ear, thought”&mdash;“what the soul
can make itself at pleasure, that I was.” For
“thrice a thousand years” he saw none but the
people of the <span class="lock">sea:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">Beings for whom the universe was made,</div>
      <div class="verse">Yet none of kindred with myself. In vain</div>

      <div class="verse">Cold as the element in which they moved,</div>
      <div class="verse">And inaccessible to fellowship</div>
      <div class="verse">With me, as sun and stars, as winds and vapours.</div>

<p>Under the sea also he <span class="lock">saw:&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>
<p>He watched the making of a coral islet, compared
with which men’s work seemed nothing. A comparison
which set him thinking of the grandeurs
of earth, among them of Babylon, built for eternity,
though where it stood,</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">Ruin itself stands still for lack of work,</div>
      <div class="verse">And Desolation keeps unbroken Sabbath....</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>He saw the islet grow and become hospitable.
The sea-wrack and many sea-changed things were
swept up on to it,</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse indent16">While heaven’s dew</div>

<p>Grass grew. Insects swarmed. He witnessed
“the age of gold in that green isle.” Trees and
flowers rose up. Reptiles and amphibious monsters
appeared. Then came “more admirable” <span class="lock">beings:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">Flocking from every point of heaven, and filling</div>

      <div class="verse">Birds, small and great, of endless shapes and colours,</div>

      <div class="verse">Upon the beach, the winds in caverns moaning,</div>
      <div class="verse">Or winds and waves abroad upon the water.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>His was an eager, rapturous temperament.
Next to birds he seems to have loved the insect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
legions&mdash;“children of light and air and fire” he
calls them,</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">Their lives all ecstasy and quick cross motion.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>But birds and insects did not confine his sympathy.
They did not, e.g., turn it aside from the
elephant, leading his quiet life “among his old
contemporary trees.”</p>

<p>Whether it was through the impulse of the
discoverer’s words, or, as is more likely, through his
own nature, he was able to suggest with some power
the world that does without men, the “sterile
wilderness” not neglected by the dew, the Paradise
without man and without death, where</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse indent16">Bliss had newly</div>
      <div class="verse">Alighted, and shut close his rainbow wings,</div>
      <div class="verse">To rest at ease, nor dread intruding ill.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>I think he was enchanted by those tropical</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">Airy aisles and living colonnades,</div>
      <div class="verse">Where nations might have worshipp’d God in peace.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>For, with an energy which a tree would call religious,
he describes their flourishing, and how the Indian
fig was <span class="lock">multiplied:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">From year to year their fruits ungather’d fall;</div>
      <div class="verse">Not lost, but quickening where they lay, they struck</div>
      <div class="verse">Root downward, and brake forth on every hand,</div>
      <div class="verse">Till the strong saplings, rank and file, stood up,</div>
      <div class="verse">A mighty army, which o’erran the isle,</div>
      <div class="verse">And changed the wilderness into a forest.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>His love of things that are not men, that are
happy and without conscience, is more instinctive
than his desire for men in his solitude. They,
though “kindred spirits,” never moved him to
a picture like the flamingoes flying,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">Till, on some lonely coast alighting,</div>
      <div class="verse">Again their gorgeous cohort took the field.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>I was not surprised, then, at the seventh canto,
to find him saying, in Wordsworthian strain, that
we only begin to live</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse indent16">From that fine point,</div>
      <div class="verse">Which memory dwells on, with the morning star,</div>
      <div class="verse">The earliest note we heard the cuckoo sing,</div>
      <div class="verse">Or the first daisy that we ever pluck’d,</div>
      <div class="verse">When thoughts themselves were stars, and birds, and flowers,</div>
      <div class="verse">Pure brilliance, simplest music, wild perfume.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>My copy of the book was printed in 1827. It had
the date 1856 under the old owner’s name; and I
suppose that not many editions have been published
since 1827, or any since 1856. Yet this
individual character of the writer, original as
much in degree as in kind, had kept the book
alive. The energy of his ecstasy gave his blank verse
a gushing flow that may cause sleep, but seldom
impatience, and never contempt. The overflowing
of so many lines into an extra unaccented syllable
seemed a natural effect of his possession by his
subject, and not a device or a mere habit. At its
best it had the eloquence of an improvisation.</p>

<p>As I shut this book it reminded me of a poem
called <cite>To Deck a Woman</cite>, by Mr. Ralph Hodgson,
where a similar rapt picture of a manless Eden is
painted, but with a passion that is controlled to
a quivering repose by an art finer than Montgomery’s.
There the passion is double, for the
poet’s love of the life and beauty of birds is turned
to an anger too deep for hate against the woman
Bloodwant, “shrill for Beauty’s veins,” and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
men who satisfy&mdash;and provoke&mdash;her desire for
feathers. The same poet’s <cite>Stupidity Street</cite> is a
curious instance of passion submitting itself
to the quietest of smiling <span class="lock">rhymes:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">I saw with open eyes</div>
      <div class="verse">Singing birds sweet</div>
      <div class="verse">Sold in the shops for</div>

<p>I was glad that I had taken <cite>Pelican Island</cite>
with me as my only book; for if I had not I might
very likely never have read it. Yet it might have
escaped me even though it was in my pocket.
Unless a man always carries a book with him,
when he does take one it is often a little too well
chosen, or rather chosen too deliberately, because
it is a very good one, or is just the right one, or is
one that ought to be read. But walking is apt to
relieve him of the kind of conscience that obeys
such choices. At best he opens the book and yawns
and shuts it. He may look about him for any
distraction rather than this book. He reads through
a country newspaper, beginning and ending with the
advertisements. He looks at every picture in an
illustrated magazine. He looks out of the window
for some temptation. He takes down <cite>The Lamplighter</cite>
or Mrs. Humphry Ward’s <cite>East Lynne</cite> from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
the landlord’s shelves. He looks through the
magazine again. If he opens the choice book he
finds in it an irresistible command to go to bed
at nine o’clock. The same book may be taken out
thus a score of times, and acquire a friendly and well-read
appearance.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX<br />

<span class="smaller">SEVENTH DAY&mdash;STREATLEY TO SPARSHOLT, ON THE
RIDGEWAY, BY SCUTCHAMER KNOB AND LETCOMBE
CASTLE</span></h2>
</div>


<p>When I was next at Streatley I took the Ridgeway
westward chiefly because I like the Ridgeway,
partly because I wished to see it again, now that
it had to give up the title conferred on it by
Bishop Bennet, of the Icknield Way. I went up
from the bridge and at the “Bull” turned to the right
and northward along the Wantage road, which is
probably the Icknield Way. After getting well up
on the chalk above the river this road maintains the
same level of from two to three hundred feet, and
for two miles keeps within a mile of the river on a
terrace half-way up the slope of the hills. Streatley
had spread itself in red spots along the side of the
road, past the fork to Wallingford and up to where
the Ridgeway turns off to the left and westward
into the long coombe leading to Streatley Warren.
At its mouth this coombe was wide and shallow,
and was all grass, except on the left hand where
there were new houses. In places, as by Rectory
Farm, the road, a hard one, had a pleasant green
terrace above it with wild roses rambling over it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
The coombe deepened and the road ascended above
a golf course near Warren Farm. Thus far it
was hedged, but soon, still mounting the right
wall of the long coombe, it was rough and hedgeless,
and old parallel tracks were to be seen above and
below it. It was now near the southern edge of
Thurle Down Woods on its right. Below, on the
left, were the steep walls of the winding coombe,
dotted by thorn, juniper, and elder, and here called
Streatley Warren. Of the unwooded coombes or
inlets into the downs this is one of the most pleasing
to me, and I shall always remember it, as I do the
great coombe winding into Butser Hill on the north
side, and others of those vast turf halls which the
sky roofs. As it passed the head of the coombe the
road was six hundred feet up, going a little north
of westwards between sheep on the left and corn on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
the right. It was two or three miles or more from
the villages on the north, Moulsford, Cholsey, the
Astons, and Blewbury, and two or three hundred
feet above them; it was almost as far away from
the Wantage road, and as far above it. The villages
on the south were nearer, but not within a mile&mdash;Aldworth,
the Comptons, and East Ilsley. It gained
a hedge near Warren Farm, but was a rough way,
now wide, now narrow, among the hazel, brier, elder,
and nettle. Sometimes there was an ash in the hedge,
and once a line of spindly elms followed it round a
curve. It was high, but not yet free among these
hedges. Then it descended, deeply worn and rough,
to where a signpost marked roads to Aldworth and
Compton on the left, Cholsey and Wallingford on
the right. Then all was open country, mostly turf,
carved by many trackways and with trees, as a
rule, only to shelter the thatched, solitary farm-house
and barns, or to make a clump and landmark
at a summit where there was a tumulus, as on
Churn Hill. The road was scattered in pieces over
the open turf among thorn bushes and alongside
a Scotch fir clump, as it went down towards Churn
station. These tracks were green with a central
white one, and that had green banks and a few
thorns. On reaching the road from Moulsford to
East Ilsley my way seemed to be continued by one
passing Chance Farm and keeping on the north side
of the hills through an uninhabited hollow among
downs which are bare of everything but grass, Churn
railway station, and a farm, except when dotted
with soldiers’ tents. But there was now a little to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
the south of this a clear and unbroken high ridge
extending westwards into Wiltshire, and this the
Ridgeway undoubtedly followed: only the connection
between my way over Roden Downs and the
higher ridge was no longer a direct one. The connecting
road was that from Moulsford to Ilsley,
and along it I had to turn round west and even
south to gain the ridge, where the Ridgeway left it
at right angles to go north-west. Hedges no longer
bounded either side of the broad turf track. It was
as free as the blue paths in the snowy heavens. It
looked down upon everything but the clouds, and
not seldom on them in the early morning or in rain.
On its left the downward slope was broken and
very gradual, so that it was far rarer to see a church
tower like Ilsley within a mile than a ridge of woods
five miles off or a bare range that might be twenty.
It was already higher than the Icknield Way at
Telegraph Hill; it had climbed out of choice, and
it would descend only of necessity. On its right the
slope was far steeper, and sometimes a little way
from the foot lay the villages; sometimes the land
rose again in several rolls this way and that, and the
nearest village would be beyond the last of them,
three or four miles away. Either corn or pure turf
and scattered furze lay about the road. One piece of
furze was called “Poor’s Furze,” and what is more,
the poor were gathering it for fuel though it was
Midsummer: tall rye came up to the edge of it.</p>

</a>
<div class="caption"><p>Ridgeway, near Streatley.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Now the Ridgeway had risen up to its perfect
freedom, away from the river and the low land,
from the glaring roads and the collections of houses.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
This way men of old came of necessity; yet I found
it hard not to think now that the road was thus
climbing to heights of speculation, to places suited
for exploring the ridges and solitudes of the spirit;
it seemed in one mood a hermit road going out into
the wilderness to meditate and be in lifelong retirement;
in another mood a road for the young, eager
warrior or reformer going up and away for a time
from cloying companions to renew his mighty
youth.</p>

<p>I saw, however, more racehorses than confirmed
hermits or aspiring warriors or reformers. Before
it was ordained that cricket should be played on
billiard tables, there were a pitch and a pavilion
here beside the Ridgeway near the Abingdon road.
Elevens drove up from Oxford, and a cheerful scene
it was, albeit nobody’s fortune was made. It was
too good and rustic a custom not to decay. After
that, they say, the pavilion became an early-morning
rendezvous for men with lurchers after the hares,
a refuge for belated soldiers, a convenience for
several breeds of idlers, philosophers, and adventurers.
These it was decided to centralize as much
as possible in prisons, workhouses, lunatic asylums,
cemeteries, town “rookeries,” and the like. The
pavilion thus became useless and was pulled down.
Nevertheless, there it is, still very clear in a number
of aging heads. So far as I could learn, it was the
nearest approach to a permanent hermitage on the
ridge of these downs. In their season there are
shepherds’ shelters, and caravans for the steam-plough
men or for persons engaged in the writing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
of books; but nothing permanent except Wayland’s
Smithy.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 550px;">
<a id="i_t235"></a>
<a href="images/zill_t235h.jpg">
<img src="images/zill_t235.jpg" width="550" height="391" alt="" />
</a>
<div class="caption"><p>Wayland’s Smithy.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Suppose a philosopher were to live in and about
these old stones, for a year or two he might be quite
undisturbed. Then he would be arrested on suspicion
after some crime. A ploughman would reveal
that he had seen the man about. It would reach a
pressman with a camera. He would get somebody
to pose either in Wayland’s Smithy or a similar
place at Wimbledon or Balham. A column about
“the simple life” would be printed in a newspaper
illustrated by these photographs. By this time the
real philosopher, a hairy and uncommunicative man,
would have been released. A rival pressman would
travel to Wantage Road with a third-class ticket,
which he would call either second or first class in his
list of expenses. He would assail the philosopher,
and with as much grace as is compatible with haste
and a preoccupied mind, would bid him describe
his experiences in answer to well-chosen leading
questions. The philosopher might possibly fail to
understand the pressman’s object, or even his
English; he might seem to refuse. Then the other
would produce his card, claiming instant attention
as the representative of both the <cite>Hourly
Deceiver</cite> and the <cite>Evening Tinkle-Tinkle</cite>. This would
amuse, puzzle, or infuriate the hairy man. His
laughter or his anger would be mistaken for rudeness.
The pressman would return to Wantage
Road and in the train invent far better things than
ever were on sea or land, and he would have no
difficulty in illustrating his article by photographs<span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
which the philosopher would never see. But the
people of the neighbourhood would see. Then boys
would go up on a Sunday afternoon and stare and
perhaps trample down the wheat. A town councillor
or a retired missionary or other man of culture would
inspect the scene. In the philosopher’s absence it
would be discovered that Wayland’s Smithy was
undrained and improperly ventilated. A woman
would be scared at a distant view of the philosopher.
It would be time for something to be done. Then
one of two things would happen. Either the man
would disappear as quietly as mist or as last year’s
books: or he would be told to go, roused to eloquence
or violence, arrested and imprisoned, and his
story told in twenty lines in the local papers. From
time to time the police of neighbouring counties
would torment him until at last he could be certified
as a lunatic. Instead of giving him a large plate
of ham and eggs, followed by apple dumplings and
then prussic acid, they would shut him up for ever
in a building with innumerable windows, from any
of which he could look out and see lunatics. Nevertheless,
he would have had that one year unmolested
at Wayland’s Smithy.</p>

<p>This, however, is only a possibility comparatively
picturesque. The real thing was less amusing,
and the scene of it was not Wayland’s Smithy but
Lone Barn. That winter a man might have picked
up the paper after breakfast and found descriptions
of funerals and marriages, the well-attended presentation
to the local member of Parliament, the
successful meeting of his rival, the list of hunting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
appointments, and a column and a half headed,
“Suffering Children&mdash;Parental Neglect&mdash;Queer Defence&mdash;Severe
Sentences&mdash;Magistrate’s Scathing
Condemnation.” A capital fox-hunter presiding, the
bench had given four months’ hard labour to a man
and wife for neglecting their seven young children
“in such a way as to cause them unnecessary suffering
and injury to their health.” Having scorched
his back parts the reader would turn his front parts
to the fire and read on. These nine had been living
for some weeks at Lone Barn, which lies unexpectedly
in a small hollow at one of the highest
points of the downs, three miles from the nearest
hamlet. It had long been deserted. The farm-house
was ruinous, and a fox taking refuge there
could not be dislodged from the fallen masonry and
elder and yew tree roots. The hunters had noticed
nothing in the barn.</p>

<p>I knew the farm-house and had often wondered
about the man who built it in that solitude somewhere
in the eighteenth century. It had walls of
unusual thickness, such as could not have been
overthrown simply by time and weather. It must
long have been empty and subject to the hostility
of discontented spirits such as probably infest a
house, as they do a man, left utterly alone. I had
not suspected that anybody was living in the barn,
but I remember a pale, shuffling man carrying a
child who begged from me monotonously as I came
down the hill in mist a little before dark. I had
given him something without exactly realizing that
he was a man, so frail, subdued, and weak-voiced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
had he been&mdash;a creation of the mist quite in harmony
with the hour. This was probably Arthur
Aubrey Bishopstone, who was now in prison.</p>

<p>He and his wife and six children had arrived at
the barn on Christmas Eve. For a week before
they had been at a barn nearer the village, but as
this had to be repaired they were turned out. They
were allowed to settle in Lone Barn because Bishopstone
had done an occasional day’s work for the
farmer on whose land it stood. During January
and February he did several more days’ work. The
wife and children remained in the barn. The two
eldest had measles, the sixth had pneumonia; all
were verminous. On Christmas Day a seventh had
been born in Lone Barn. The mother, who had
fainted in court a week before and had been remanded,
pleaded guilty of neglect, but said that
“she could not do in a barn as she could in a cottage,”
there being no bed, no furniture, and no water
except from a cattle pond half a mile away. The
man had been unable to get a cottage. The family
had been found lying round a fire in the barn, and
after medical examination arrested. Bishopstone
hardly spoke in answer to the questions and insults
of the bench, but he was understood to say, “The
Lord is on my side,” and several other blasphemous
or unintelligible things, which were no defence or
excuse. The nine were now condemned to the
comfort of the workhouse and the prison until haymaking
time.</p>

<p>I went to Lone Barn again, the birthplace of
Francis Albert Edward Bishopstone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<p>The black brook, full of the white reflections of
its snowy banks and beginning to steam in the sun,
was hourly growing and coiling all its long loops
joyously through the land. The dabchick was
laughing its long shrill titter under the alder roots.
Faint, soft shadows fell on to the snow from the
oaks, whose grey skeletons were outlined in snow
against the clear deep blue of the now dazzling sky.
Thrushes were beginning to sing, as if it had always
been warm and bright. In hedge and thicket and
tall wood, myriads of drops were falling and singing
in the still air. Against the south the smooth downs
were white under a diaphanous haze of grey, and
upon them seemed to rest heavenly white mountains,
very still, dream-like, and gently luminous. Lone
Barn lay up in the haze invisible.</p>

<p>At the foot of the hills the land was divided by
low hedges into broad fields. There no birds sang
and no stream gurgled. The air was full of the
pitiful cries of young lambs at their staggering play
in the shallow snow. One ewe stood with her new-born
lamb in a stamped, muddy circle tinged with
blood amidst the pure white. The lamb was yellowish
green in colour; it stumbled at her teats, fell
down and sucked upon its knees. The big mother
stood still, shaggy, stubborn, meek, with her head
down, her eyes upon me, her whole nature upon
the lamb buried in her wool, part of her.</p>

<p>The hill was hedgeless save where a narrow,
ancient road deeply trenched it in ascending curves,
lined by thorns. The road had probably not been
trodden since that procession of ten had descended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
towards the town six miles away. A kestrel had
killed a gold-crest upon the bank, and as I approached
it sailed away from the crimson-centred
circle of feathers on the snow. But the wind had
been the chief inhabitant of the slopes, and unseen
of mortal eyes it had been luxuriously, playfully
carving the snow which submerged the hedge. The
curved wind-work in the drift, deeply ploughed or
deliberately chiselled, remained in the stillness as a
record of the pure joy of free, active life contented
with itself. It was the same blithe hand which had
shaped the infant born in this black barn.</p>

<p>An old plum tree, planted when barn and house
were built, and now dead and barkless, stood
against one end, and up it had climbed a thick ivy
stem that linked barn and tree inseparably with a
profusion of foliage, emerald and white. The last
of its doors lay just outside in the dead embers of the
tramps’ fire. Thus open on both sides to the snow-light
and the air the barn looked the work rather
of nature than of man. The old thatch was grooved,
riddled, and gapped, and resembled a grassy bank
that has been under a flood the winter through;
covered now in snow it had the outlines in miniature
of the hill on which it was built. The patched walls,
originally of tarred timber laid in horizontal planks,
were of every hue of green and yellow that moss,
lichen, and mould can bestow, each strip of board
being of a different date and a different shade.
What gave them something in common with one
another was the fresh black stains which ran from
the melting eaves to the nettle-bed below. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
porches, lofty enough to admit a waggon piled as
high as possible with sheaves of corn, had slipped
somewhat away: it was to them alone that the
exterior of the building owed a faint suggestion of
a church and, consequently, a pathetic, undermined
dignity: without them it would have seemed wholly
restored to nature, amiably and submissively ruinous,
with a silence in which not the most perverse
mind could have detected melancholy. But within
it was unexpectedly lofty, and the ponderous open
timber-work, rough-hewn and naturally curved,
was obviously performing too efficiently the task
of supporting the roof: it at once inspired the
thought that it should ere now have relaxed
the strain of its crooked arms and acquiesced and
slipped or collapsed. The oak floor was pierced in
many places by wear and by drippings from the
broken roof; grass and corn had grown up through
the crevices and died. Some of the fallen thatch
had been piled in a dry corner for a bed. In the
centre of the floor was another sign of its late use&mdash;squares
chalked by the children for the playing of a
game. I walked to and fro. There were no ghosts,
or so it seemed.</p>

<p>A starved thrush lay dead in a corner. That was
all. I stirred the bed with my stick, meaning to
set fire to it. An old coat was concealed beneath it,
and out of the pocket fell a book.</p>

<p>On the front page was written, “A. A. Bishopstone,
&mdash;&mdash; College, Oxford, October, 1890.” The first
pages were filled with accounts of expenditure, subscriptions,
purchases, etc., the items abbreviated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
as a rule beyond recognition. Apparently he had
soon ceased to keep accounts. Several pages were
torn out and a mere few left only to save their other
halves farther on. The book had then begun to
serve another purpose. Under the date March,
1891, there was a list of books read during the term
ending in that month&mdash;“<cite>The Letters of Flaubert</cite>,
Gilchrist’s <cite>Blake</cite>, etc.” He had meant to make a
comment on this reading, perhaps, but it was crossed
out deliberately lest he should be tempted to decipher
the hateful thing. He had left only the words, “It
is a mistake to leave comments of this kind on
record, as in after years one is unable to get back
at their meaning and the imperfectly expressive
words are irritating and humiliate. The mere names
of books read, people seen, places walked to and
the like are more eloquent far. This day I have
burnt my old diaries. They help the past to haunt
us out of its grave.” Consequently there were from
time to time carelessly written jottings of names of
books, lists of places visited with dates: they were
eloquent enough. On some pages short poems and
passages of prose were copied out in a very neat
hand, showing a kind of priestly sense of reverence
for Claudian’s poem <cite>On the Sirens</cite>, etc. These
entries needed no comment, the serious worship
implied in the caligraphy was unmistakable;
Bishopstone would have no difficulty in recalling
to his mind the mood in which they were copied
out. They were headed usually by no more than
the year in which they were written down, sometimes
not at all. Thus he wrote “1892” at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
head of a page and apparently added nothing, for
it was in an altered hand that the prayer from
Shelley was <span class="lock">copied:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">Make me thy lyre even as the forest is.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Next, in March of the same year, he had written
down, perhaps from dictation, the names of historical
books, with a few words showing that in the
following summer he would have to go up for the
examination which had qualified him for a degree.
Evidently he was resolved to work hard at special
books and to put behind him the intellectual
luxuries of Rabelais, etc. Whether he read too hard
or not is uncertain, but the entry for September of
that year was merely, “Brain fever and a 2nd class.
I am now alone.”</p>

<p>The next entry was in 1893: “Sell all thou hast
and follow Me.” In the same year came the words:
“I possess my working clothes and a Greek testament.
I earn 14s. a week.”</p>

<p>There was no more for that year, but under 1894
were a number of detached thoughts, such <span class="lock">as:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“‘All men are equal’ is only a corollary of ‘All
men are different’&mdash;if only the former had been
forgot instead of latter. It might have changed
things less&mdash;and more.”</p>

<p>“Forgive we one another, for we know not what
we do.</p>

<p>“Each man suffers for the whole world and the
whole world for each man. There is little distinction
between the destinies of one man and another if
this is understood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>

<p>“Let us not exalt worldly distinctions, titles,
etc., by saying that they make no difference.”</p>

<p>In 1895 came the words, “East Anglia&mdash;the Fens&mdash;Yorkshire&mdash;the
Lakes,” and the isolated thought:</p>

<p>“To be alone in eternity is the human lot of a
man, but to be alone in time, alas! alas!”</p>

<p>The next year he had not touched the book: it
was the year of his marriage, for in 1897 he had
written: “We have now been married one year.”
A list of villages followed showing a zigzag course
right across England; then the thought: “There is
nothing like the <em>visible</em> solitude of another soul to
teach us our own. Two hungers, two thirsts, two
solitudes, begetting others.”</p>

<p>Was it perhaps at the birth of a child&mdash;the date
is not given, it might have been the same year, 1897&mdash;that
he wrote this? “To him who is born into
eternity it matters little what happens in time, and
a generation of pain is as the falling of a leaf.”
<span class="lock">Then:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“Unhappiness is apart from pain. When they
tell us that in the Middle Ages and even in the last
century men suffered more pain and discomfort than
we, they do not tell us that they also had less unhappiness.
Many a battlefield has seen more joy
than pain; many a festival as little of either.”</p>

<p>And then, on a page to <span class="lock">itself:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“We are looking for straight oak sticks in a world
where it is hazel that grows straight.”</p>

<p>That he was still travelling was indicated only by
names of places written down without comment. A
week’s accounts showed the expenditure of 10s.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
on the food of himself, his wife, and John and Paul,
two children. In March, 1898, he <span class="lock">wrote:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“The road northward out of Arundel leads to
Heaven”; to which he had added, “So does Lavender
Hill.”</p>

<p>Other thoughts were set down in the same year:</p>

<p>“The man who is discontented with this world is
like a blackbird who desires to be a plover that calls
by night in the wandering sky.</p>

<p>“To have loved truly, be it for an hour only, is
to be sure of eternity. Love is eternity. And if we
have not loved, then also we are destined to eternity
in order that in some other condition we may yet
love.</p>

<p>“If only we did not <em>know</em> that in this world it is
often well to attempt what it would not be well to
achieve.</p>

<p>“Preach extravagance and extremes and ideals
that haply we may achieve something above
mediocrity. If we preach compromise we may not
achieve more than desolation. And yet even out
of desolation may bloom the rose.</p>

<p>“Exactly the same proportion of marriages as of
illicit unions are immoral, even in a worldly sense.”</p>

<p>In 1899 it must have been the death of a child
that dictated the <span class="lock">words:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“I do not shed tears: I did that when she was
born, for I saw her lie dead in the cot where she
smiled.”</p>

<p>There was a long interval and then one short
<span class="lock">entry:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“I possess everything, but in the world’s sense<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
nothing but my name&mdash;A. A. B.; if I could lose that
I should be a better citizen, not of the world, but
of the universe of eternity. Are the stars called
Procion and Lyra except by astronomers? Then
why should I have a name?&mdash;unless, indeed, there
were a name which described me as a poem describes
an emotion. I will be nameless. I will no longer
condemn myself to this title of A. A. B.”</p>

<p>The next and final entries all belonged to the
winter which he spent in the barn.</p>

<p>On Christmas <span class="lock">Eve:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“Life will never be better or nobler, nor has ever
been, than here at this instant in my breast. But&mdash;may
I never be content to know it lest to-morrow
and to-morrow and to-morrow be the less for it.”</p>

<p><span class="lock">Then:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“What is man? One moment he is a prayer,
another a flower of God, another a flame to consume
he knows not what save that it is himself. And,
again, he is but a dungeon in which an infant’s cry
is echoing. One day I saw soldiers, and I was
nothing but, as it were, a sea-shell to record the
clattering hoofs, the scarlet, the shattering trumpet.</p>

<p>“The children have a doll that was given to them.
They are talking to it and about it&mdash;as I talk to
and about another man.</p>

<p>“I heard the wind rustle in the dead leaves this
morning, I heard it rustle over my grave, and
over the world’s, and over the embers of all the
stars, and I was not afraid.</p>

<p>“What name has my beautiful barn in heaven?
In it was born a man in the sight of his brothers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
and sisters. God has told me my seed shall be
multiplied as the sands of the sea. Can it be that
out of this barn will grow the regeneration of the
world, or will the forgotten memory of it trouble
the well-being of some citizen far hence in time and
so give birth to a flame, a prayer, a rose out of the
soul of him? It is cold, yes, but the frost is one of
the angels.</p>

<p>“A doctor has been here, a man not used to our
life. He too felt that it was cold. He said that
little Francis&mdash;whom Mary calls Albert Edward&mdash;is
ill and may die. If he does, then it may be from
the corpse of an infant the saviour of society will
be born.”</p>

<p>These were the last words. On the day after the
doctor’s visit the arrest was made. Arthur Aubrey
Bishopstone and two of the children died in the
infirmary of the prison. Francis Albert Edward,
born at Lone Barn on Christmas Day, recovered
from the effects of his birth and left the workhouse
at the end of June with his mother and four brothers.
I believe that after Lone Barn there was nothing
they missed less than Arthur Aubrey Bishopstone.
If they had been given to considering such matters,
they would have said that he ought to have lived
solitary and let his hair grow in Wayland’s Smithy
instead of marrying and begetting seven children,
of whom only two were able to die in infancy.</p>

<p>Lone Barn has since been burnt to the ground,
and should Francis Albert Edward (his real name)
or the world visit the scene of his nativity, to worship
or verify the facts, they would find in that hollow of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
the downs only a square space of nettles, poppies,
and bachelor’s buttons, amidst the turf....</p>

<p>Coming to the telegraph posts of Abingdon Lane&mdash;the
Abingdon and Newbury road&mdash;the turf was
furrowed this way and that. Gorse and thorn, surrounding
the crossing of the straight, white road
and the green way, made a frame as for some wayside
event of no common kind, such as the birth of
Francis; but the sun shone and the wind blew and
betrayed nothing. Then the road was a central
track of very little rutted turf, and flowers and long
grass on either side; it had banks, but no thorns
growing on them. The valley was beautiful,
the mile-distant tedded hay looking like sea sand,
the elms very dark in their lines or masses above
the green corn, the villages hidden and the single
farm-houses dim among trees, and the land rising
beyond to a ridge saddled here and there with dark
clumps on the horizon. In one place a far-off upland
of newly ploughed chalk was almost snowy in
misty whiteness. The clouds of the sky and the hot
mist of earth dimmed the pale ploughland and the
corn until the trees appeared to be floating on them
as on a sea. They were cutting hay a little way off
to my left, and as the horses and the mowing-machine
came into sight at some speed it seemed
to me that but for the seat it was probably much
like a British war chariot. To the right the slope
of the down was turf. Sometimes the road had a
bank on each side, sometimes only on one; near
the crossing of the road to East Hendred it was for
a time without a bank; in other places the ditch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
was clearer than the bank. There was corn with
its poppies, white campions, and charlock on the
right, hay on the left. Woods, now on the left and
now on the right, sometimes touched the road;
but they never reached it from both sides at once&mdash;it
never passed through a wood. In one of the
roadside woods on the left a great tumulus stood
disembowelled among the beeches: this was
Scutchamer Knob on Cuckhamsley Hill&mdash;or, as I
have heard it called, “Scotchman’s Hob.” This
name an old carter had apparently justified to himself
in part by the fact that an old road coming
from the north&mdash;perchance from Scotland&mdash;passes
close by, namely Hungerford Lane, which has a
separate existence from Milton Hill near Steventon
to Land’s End on Knoll End Down near Farnborough.</p>

<p>Above Lockinge Park the road was about forty
yards wide of level turf, between a bank and fence
on the right and a natural low wall of turf above
it on the left. But the new reservoir, the new
plantation of firs and their iron fences, at this point
might have persuaded the traveller that Lockinge
Park was going to absorb the Ridgeway as it did
the Icknield Way two centuries ago. At a very
high point near by was a slender white column and
cross upon a mound of turf erected in memory of
Robert Loyd Lindsay, Baron Wantage, by his wife.
The road went lightly away from this over the bare
turf, having on its left the thorny slopes of Yew
Down and on the right a sunken tumulus. Several
deep tracks descended towards Lockinge, and at a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
tumulus beyond the first road to Wantage a branch
entered on the left from Farnborough exactly like
the main track&mdash;if it can be called a branch that
was itself a parish boundary and gave its course to
the main track for some distance. This tumulus
formed part of the right bank of the Ridgeway.</p>

<p>I noticed that I seldom did more than glance
at the country southward on my left. The steep
downward slope that was never far off on the right,
the wide vale below and the very distant hills sometimes
visible beyond, could always draw my eyes
from the south. On that side there was a beautiful
region falling and then rising again to a height not
much lower than the Ridgeway, and crowned with
trees at the top of the rise, as e.g. beyond Fawley.
There were several rough, thorny slopes on that
side, each thorn distinct; and these are peculiarly
attractive. Yet I could not look at them long. It
was the same when I walked back in the opposite
direction. The vale spread out in the north was
satisfying, and the horizon was distant enough to
quiet if it ever awakened desire: I never wished to
descend. The two or three miles of country visible
in the south was far more positively attractive, as
well as by chance less known to me. Perhaps the
horizon was too near and was soon merely tantalizing:
certainly it gave no rest. Also the land
fell away very little before rising again to this
horizon, and consequently gave none of the pleasure
of a low and, as it were, subject landscape. The
scene awakened desire, but I could not turn aside to
satisfy it. Therefore, perhaps, since it could not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
be satisfied and stilled as by the distant northern
horizon, I turned away.</p>

<p>The road was going broad and green and straight
between bare banks in the course set by the tributary
from Farnborough, when suddenly it bent to
the south for a few yards, and then again west by a
little pond under some willows. It descended, much
narrowed and hedged, past the ash trees and
sycamores of White House, and then, with a sharp
northward turn along the Wantage road and in a
few yards another to the west at Red House, it
recovered its direction and presumably its original
course. Probably the half a mile or more between
the two crooks is not an innovation, but the crooks
themselves are, as it were, the punishment inflicted
on the old road by two newer or at some time more
vigorous roads cutting across it.</p>

</div>

<p>Beyond Red House I passed Letcombe Castle or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
Segsbury Camp, the road running close and parallel
to its straight south side. A road crossed mine and
penetrated the green ramparts of the camp from
a corrugated-iron farm that stood with a thatched
barn under some ash trees&mdash;behind it a grassy down
with clumps beyond. The road was now so broad
that it was hardly at all marked except downhill,
or where a crossway roughened it, or at some
busy section between one cross-road and another,
where it would have one narrow, well-worn strip.
At the right-hand turning to Letcombe Bassett
stood a sycamore and some ash trees, and there
were roses in the thorn hedge. Letcombe Bassett
was at the foot of a round buttress of the downs
called Gramp’s Hill, but was half hidden in grouped
trees which continued above and alongside the
winding white road to Letcombe Regis a mile
beyond. Gramp’s Hill and the next and far more
prominent hill formed between them a long, deep
hollow, winding up into the hill and terraced on
its slopes with flights of green steps. This winding
made almost an island of a small hill, round and
flat-topped, and the top of this hill had been mown
and a waggon in the centre was being loaded with
hay. Here was the place to build a castle in the
air&mdash;and also on the turf of the downs. The man
who did so would probably inhabit somewhat longer
than the philosopher did Wayland’s Smithy. He
might live there even until he died. But it is not
likely that his heir&mdash;supposing that he had an heir&mdash;would
continue after him. In any case it would
at once be called the “Folly.” Clumps of trees<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
planted on high places to please the eye and to be
a landmark are now called “Follies” almost as a
matter of course. Any house built high or in a great
solitude is likely to be called a “Folly.” A house
may earn the name by having walls more than a
foot thick, in a district of jerry-builders where
builders are bankrupt once a month. Thus people
condemn the extraordinary. If it is a little thing
like a white blackbird, they shoot at it: if it is a
big, helpless thing like a whale stranded in Cornwall,
they carve it alive. But to call it a “Folly” and
have done with it is the most innocent form of
condemnation. In fact, it is by this time rather
venerably pretty. They call the far-seen clump
of beeches on Liddington Hill the “Folly”; the
clump a quarter-mile north-west of Wayland’s
Smithy is Odstone Folly; Ashbury Folly is the
clump at the crossing over the Ridgeway down to
Ashbury Church. They call a house a “Folly”
with less benevolence. They see&mdash;or they feel&mdash;in
the strange, high, or solitary situation part of an
attempt to mould the course and conditions of life,
or to escape from them. They see&mdash;or they dimly
imagine&mdash;a being who is trying to make his, or
some woman’s, like a poem, or like a work of <span class="lock">art&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">Carved with figures strange and sweet,</div>
      <div class="verse">All made out of the carver’s brain....</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>It is not that they see the blasphemy of it like
that of Babel or of the Titans. But they know that
the builders of Babel and the Titans will fail, and
if they cannot beat them themselves they will be
on the side of the one who can. I should myself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
be sorry to see a house&mdash;such a one as is likely to be
built&mdash;on that island between Gramp’s and Hackpen
hills. But if it were such a house as Morgan’s
Folly! I warmed with the thought of transporting
that hill-top tower to this peninsulated table of turf,
by the expenditure of a sum sufficient to have given
a free library to Letcombe Bassett.</p>

<p>I do not know if it was called a Folly, but there
was a plantation at the cross-road from Sparsholt
to Lambourn which I liked&mdash;a long, narrow plantation
of beeches close together alongside the cross-road
and touching the Ridgeway on one side; on
the other was a tumulus. Here it was a broad road
with no hedges, there being corn on the right, and
sheep, enclosed by a wire fencing, on the left. It
was now near its highest point, nearly eight hundred
feet, at the Hill Barn that stands with its company
of stacks amidst a group of ash trees above Sparsholt.
The purple meadow crane’s-bill was growing
beside the road near Hill Barn.</p>

<p>I left the Ridgeway that morning by the Blowingstone
Hill and its woods, and went to Sparsholt,
which has a quarter-mile of chestnut and lime,
and then beech and elm shadow on the road to its
church. One bee was buzzing inside as I walked
over the stones and brasses of the floor and looked
at the Commandments, the Creed, the Lord’s
Prayer, and the royal arms, on the wall, but chiefly
at three recumbent stone effigies lying asleep and
private within a chapel, guarded by stone lions,
railings, and a locked gate.</p>

</div>


<p>I was going through Sparsholt the next day just
after the children had gone into school after their
mid-morning play. The road was quieter than the
church on that hot, bright morning. As I walked
under the garden trees I came slowly within hearing
of a melody played so lightly, or so far lost among
winds or leaves, that I could hardly distinguish it.
It was an hour when nearly everyone is at work.
A poor, ragged girl was walking in front of me
in awkward haste. But she stopped at the same
time as I did, to listen. The music was not everything.
The shadow and the filtered light, the
silence of the music half submerged, the busy hour
so steeped in tranquillity, helped the player to
express perfect carelessness and freedom from the
conditions of life&mdash;summer, wealth, luxury, happiness,
youth, gaiety, innocence, and benevolence.
They expressed it for us, as that river-side garden
picture at Watlington doubtless expressed it for
others. But presently the player lighted upon
a melody which took me right away from Sparsholt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
and the summer morning and the tranquillity. I
could not catch every note, but even the fragmentary
skeleton of “Caradoc’s Hunt” could not be mistaken.
At a first hearing this old hunting song
seemed to be much the same thing as Scott’s</p>

<p>Many have heard it and thought it just one of the
best, perhaps the princeliest, of hunting songs.
With a little change it might have been a battle
song; for it was martial and high-tempered, and
would launch cavalry as well as huntsmen. It
was a little too nervously quick and dancing for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
a battle song; such pace, such height of spirit
could not endure. Yet the trumpets before a charge
have often brought the song into the hearts of young
soldiers, and their chargers and they have done
extravagant things for the gay tune’s sake. It
suggested the haughtiness and celerity of youth,
audacious and fantastic pleasures, voices of command
and laughter, many-coloured and all splendid
dresses, neighing and prancing horses, hounds lazily
quarrelling in the sun, gallant March weather. The
gates of a castle stood all wide open for the first time
since the beginning of winter, and arrowy winds and
humid fragrance were invading the stale shadows.
As the first flowers break out of the old, dark earth,
so the youths and maidens with their purple and
gold, green and white, broke out of this old, dark
castle upon the Welsh moorland. The sharp horseshoes
trampled the first green of spring and the
first yellow blossoms, even as the riders would
trample the hearts of men and women, and as freely
upon their own hearts, their own strength and
health and happiness. The sunlight played like
a thousand sprites, on rippling waters, on the gold
and silver ornaments of riders and horses, on horns
of gold. Bright as the sun, clear as the west wind,
joyous as the heart of man and hound and horse
sounded the horns.</p>

<p>There was nothing more in the three verses,
there seemed little more in the melody. After
a little talk and much laughter and shouting with
deep and shrill voices, blowing of horns, cheering,
and chiding of steeds, summoning and urging of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
hounds, they rode away. They climbed the wild
hills and saw an angry sea of yet wilder hills in
the distance. They descended into the rich vales.
They scattered joyfully. They gathered together
as joyfully. They feasted until better than any
wit or beauty or adventure seemed sleep. Then
they slept.</p>

<p>Other listeners to the song might think rather of
a later hunt assembling before a cheerful Georgian
mansion with many windows, and behind one of
them a lady playing “Caradoc’s Hunt” on a spinet,
and warbling it in Saxon. I thought of such a
one as I heard the invisible lady playing at Sparsholt.</p>

<p>Others, again, would be content with nothing
later than the age of chivalry and the <cite>Mabinogion</cite>.
The hunters would all be auburn or yellow-haired
young men. They are clad in yellow tunics, green
hose, and shoes of parti-coloured leather clasped
at the instep with gold. Some carry bows of ivory
strung with deer sinews, the shafts of whalebone
headed with gold and winged with peacock’s
feathers. Others have silver-headed spears of ash-wood
coloured azure. All wear whalebone-hafted
and gold-hilted daggers and horns of ivory. Their
hunting is earnest, though elaborated with much
decoration of custom, style, and ceremony. They
are men who must go hungry but for the chase.
They run or ride to hunt the stag or the boar, and
nobly beautiful and blithe look they as they begin
to move away from the castle, and their tall, brindled
white-breasted greyhounds, wearing collars of rubies,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
are sporting like sea-swallows from side to side of
them. But they may encounter foes instead of
quarry; they may kill or be killed by young braves
from other borders. So with all the gallantry of
dress and harping there is something grim in
their going forth; nor is it idle bombast for
one among them to ride out carrying only what
he calls the mightiest of all weapons&mdash;the harp&mdash;on
which he plays “Caradoc’s Hunt” at the
starting.</p>

<p>These things and others, according to the singer
and the hearer, the song readily suggested. But
they are mistaken who are contented by these
suggestions, sufficient as they are for a warm
summer’s morning in a green lane. They are
deceived by the qualities which “Caradoc’s Hunt”
has in common with other hunting songs, especially
by the galloping rhythm and the notes like a
challenge of horns. Even when that boastful
riding harper played it the tune was old. He was
a bard, and though he played it for the young
hunters for the flashes of gaiety and mettle upon
its surface, it intrigued his own heart with a rich
mystery of antiquity. Already legend as well as
the bards and harpers had begun to play with the
melody. It was said, for example, to have been
the favourite hunting song of the “Lady of the
Night” in her earthly days, and even that she sang
it, or had it sung and harped to her, now that she
was an inhabitant of night and the underworld.
Solitary, benighted peasants or travellers saw her
black hair streaming over her green vest and crimson<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
mantle as she galloped fiercely over the mountains or
in the heavens. Her horse was white. She hallooed as
she rode in a wild voice, at times harsh and abrupt
like a heron’s, at others clear and laughing like a
wood-owl’s. The hounds streamed after her, howling
in tumultuous chorus, and the sound grew louder
as the pack raced farther and farther away. They
were the hounds of the underworld. They followed
her in a stream or fan as closely as if the foremost
held the tip of her mantle. In some packs the
hounds were small, and were white all over except
the shells of their ears, which were rose-coloured;
and they had eyes like lighted pearls. Some were
black with red spots, others red with black spots.
There were also hounds all blood-red, with eyes of
flame. They hunted the spirits of men destined to
die soon, or of the dead who were unfit either for
heaven or for hell. They prophesied deaths and
calamity. However fierce, they were always even
frantically joyous, but some thought the hallooing
of the lady was often close to lamentation. Only
when the sound of “Caradoc’s Hunt” was heard
was she as joyous as her hounds. Her sadness
made it believed in places that she was no huntress
at all, but the quarry, or at least that she hunted
for a punishment, that she was doomed by god
or devil thus to flee all night through cloudland
or the most desert regions of earth. Hunting or
hunted, it was certain that she was powerless to
change her fate. Hunting was what she most loved
on earth. Perhaps she still loved it, or she was
being punished for the crime of pride or immoderate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
love of the chase. One story was that she had been
very beautiful and vain of her beauty, and on her
death-bed had exacted a promise to bury her in
her most radiant apparel. Another story, more
venerable, was that she had so loved hunting as to
cry out once in a strong passion: “I care nothing
for heaven if I cannot hunt there.” When she died,
therefore, her spirit was cursed with an everlasting
compulsion to slake this most dear desire. She
had to hunt eternally with the hounds of the underworld.
When she heard “Caradoc’s Hunt” she could
not but start or follow the chase. “If I forget
‘Caradoc’s Hunt,’ then I shall be dead indeed,”
she said. “I shall be quiet and sleepy as anyone
else among the ghosts.” When men saw her dark
eyes flashing at thought of the song they could not
believe that if anything of this beautiful creature
was to survive the immortal remnant would
not take with it “Caradoc’s Hunt.” She heard
it at many different and some monstrous times.
People thought that the tune was in her head,
but she averred that she heard it outside&mdash;in the
clouds or the trees or the hallooing woods&mdash;and
her immediate attendants knew this to be true.
She would break away from marriage or funeral
to ride. She would suddenly rise up from mass to
mount. She would dress at dead of night, uncouple
the hounds, and hunt alone. Love, wine, sleep,
religion were impotent against the melody. Everyone
admitted that it was a beautiful melody;
they called it gay, or spirited, or said that it was
perfectly suitable to a knightly company of riders.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
This lady heard it and rode away. Hers was not
the fate of the lord of Radnor Castle. He and his
hounds impiously passed the night in the church of
Llan-Avan, near Builth, to be near the day’s coverts
early; but when he rose at the dawn he found himself
blinded and his hounds mad, so that he escaped
only with difficulty, to earn pardon by a pilgrimage
to the Holy Land. The lady’s life was charmed.
She rode anywhere without fear. She died young,
but it was in bed. On horseback she could defy
man or God.</p>

<p>Such was the Lady of the Night, and her legend
was at least not unworthy of “Caradoc’s Hunt.”
But as the belief in the hounds of the underworld
is earlier than the Middle Ages and the ghostly
hunter in darkness more venerable than the Norman
lady, so is the tune. The legend might have grown
to explain the tune, and it does help to illuminate
the depths of which the surviving words, the
mere cheerful chivalry, are no more than the
glancing surface. But the tune has depth under
depth, and when it is heard the plummet of the soul
sinks to a profound far below the region of the
lady who rides by night. What darkness the
plummet fathoms, what “bottom of the monstrous
world” it touches, is not to be understood. Perhaps
the mystery is only that which at once haloes
and enshrouds common things when we no longer
feel them as common. But if at the sounding of
the melody the mind’s eye still sees a cavalcade of
antique hunters, it is not stag or boar or questing
beast that they are to follow; the castle that sends<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
them out of its gates and may receive them at
nightfall is no feudal or faery stronghold, but an
image, perhaps, of the great world itself.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>The Blowingstone.</p></div>
</div>

<p>But I must confess the melody did not lighten
my step as I mounted again to the Ridgeway by
Blowingstone Hill. The Blowingstone is a block of
brown, iron-like sarsen stone standing on end, and
of such a height that a man can bend over and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
comfortably blow into the mouthpiece at the upper
side. This natural mouthpiece is the small roundish
entrance to a funnel through the stone which
emerges at a larger hole lower down at the back.
A well-breathed person blowing bugle-fashion can
make a booming that is said even now to carry five
miles, if sustained for some time. At the hill-top,
where it stood before it became a procurer of charity,
a skilled and deep-chested hillman might have
made himself heard much farther. From this
hill-top, nearly seven hundred feet high, the Ridgeway
rises to its greatest height. Hitherto it had
hardly ever had higher land on either side of it
for very many miles. At Uffington Castle it is
over eight hundred feet high, but a little lower
than the highest part of the camp. From the
rampart about this circle of almost level turf I
could see the Quarley Hill range and far over the
Lambourn Downs to Martinsell Hill by Savernake;
I could see Barbury Castle and the wooded hills of
Clyffe and Wroughton, and Badbury, the Cotswolds,
the Oxfordshire hills, Sinodun, and the Chilterns.
The Dragon Hill below it is an isolated eminence
shaped like the butt of an oak tree, and similar to
that one in the hollow between Gramp’s and Hackpen
hills, but ruder and more distinct.</p>

<p>Past the south and lower side of Uffington Castle
the Ridgeway went fairly straight, with a thorn
or two on either side, towards the thick beech
clump above Wayland’s Smithy, sometimes a green
road, sometimes worn white. The hill-side was
divided among charlock and different greens in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
squares and triangles, and here and there a
thatched barn or rick at a corner. Southward I
saw the pleasant, dappled scatter of Knighton
Bushes over the turf, sometimes considerable woods
like those of Ashdown by Alfred’s Castle; in several
places the long stretch of turf reared itself up with
beautiful but detached hills, like Tower Hill, as
high as the main ridge. The hot, misty sun drew
out all the odour from uncut grass, clover, cockscombs,
yellow bedstraw, ox-eye daisies, and bird’s-foot
trefoil, and the light air mixed them. Whatever
was visible or hid on the left, the road always
commanded the northward valley, the main expanse,
and also for the most part the nearer land where
the villages lay, close to the foot of the hills on which
it was travelling. An enemy might have lain or
moved concealed within a very short distance on
the south, but never on the north, and it might be
conjectured, therefore, that attack was to be feared
from that side only, and that the other was friendly
country to those most commonly upon the road.
The camps of Lowbury, Letcombe, and Uffington
were all to northward; Alfred’s Castle alone was
on the south, at Ashdown, among the greatest
woods now surviving on this part of the Downs.
It is hardly possible for unhistorically minded men
to think of war on these hills, unless troops are
manœuvring over them. Yet the Ridgeway is
like nothing so much as a battlement walk of
superhuman majesty. The hills between Streatley
and Liddington form a curve in the shape of a
bow, a doubly curved Cupid’s bow. Following this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
line, always keeping at the edge of the steep northward
slope and surveying the valley, the Ridgeway
carries the traveller for thirty miles as if along the
battlements of a castle. He begins at Streatley by
having the early morning sun of spring over his
right shoulder; the full light of midday is on his
left as he passes Letcombe Castle; the sun is going
down on his right hand as he descends to Totterdown
and the pass for the Roman road and modern
traffic between the hills.</p>

<p>It is still debated whether most or little of the
downland was once covered with trees. Those
recently planted on very high places have often
failed to make more than a spindly and ruinous
growth, as at Chanctonbury Ring, Liddington
Hill, and Barbury. But wherever there is a tertiary
deposit beech and oak, not to speak of lesser trees,
abound and even flourish in great size and noble
forms. Gorse, hawthorn, and elder rapidly take
possession anywhere of neglected ground, and make
an impenetrable scrub. Yews expand and beeches
grow tall and close on steep and almost precipitous
slopes where the chalk is easily bared by rain,
traffic, or rabbits. There is thus some reason for
thinking that the open downland is largely the
product of cultivation and nibbling flocks.</p>

<p>The flocks no longer feed much on the hills, and,
except when folded in squares of turnips or mustard,
are seldom seen there. They have become more and
more a kind of living machinery for turning vegetables
into mutton, and only in their lambhood or
motherhood are they obviously of a different tribe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
from sausage-machines, etc. In time, with the discovery
of a way of concentrating food and sunlight
and of adapting the organs of the sheep to these
essences, it will be possible to dine carnivorously on
Sunday upon what was grass on Friday; but “for
ever climbing up the climbing wave,” men shall sigh
for lambs born filleted with a double portion of
sweetbreads.</p>

<p>From Uffington Castle the road descended slowly,
and reached six hundred feet at the Wiltshire
border, a third of a mile past the road from Idstone
to Ashdown. Then gradually it rose towards a
point much above seven hundred feet between
two distinct breasts of down south-westward. In
places it had a good hedge of thorn, maple, and
brier on one side, at others only isolated little
thickets of thorn, brier, and black bryony, or
groups where the last May-blossom met the first
guelder roses. Once at a corner before Ridgeway
Farm five beeches stood together making a shadow.
The highest point showed me the beeches of Liddington
clump, each stem distinct, the fall of clear
turf down to the plain, and beyond that the
Barbury clump and the long down wall bending
to Avebury.</p>

<p>The Ridgeway was now rapidly descending, with
a disused track on the left, to the gap where the
Roman Ermine Street from Silchester to Gloucester,
now the Swindon and Hungerford road, penetrated
the hills. Without this descent from its ridge the
road must have turned back so as to point almost
to Streatley again, and it would have done this to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
avoid only about a mile of lowland before rising
again to the hills which were its natural soil. Probably
it did so rise, though the road called the Ridgeway
in Ordnance Maps keeps to the lowland for five
or six miles.</p>

<p>I crossed Ermine Street at Totterdown and an
inn called “Shepherd’s Rest,” and the Ridgeway
became a hard road of ordinary width between
hedges and ditches. It was more like the Icknield
Way than the Ridgeway, and still greater was this
likeness when it reached Liddington, but made
no effort to climb again to the ridges, or to keep
Liddington Camp on its north side. One road does
climb the ridge, going south-westward to Liddington
Hill, and then south, having turned from this
present road to the left at a point marked by the
“Ridgeway Bush” in the time of Hoare&mdash;three-quarters
of the way from Totterdown to the Swindon
road. But the Ordnance Map gives the name of
Ridgeway to a road going straight across the low
land to Barbury, mounting the hill on the north
side of that camp, and continuing along the ridge
beyond Barbury to near Avebury, up over the
downs again to the Avon Valley, up to Salisbury
Plain, and across it, perhaps, to the Dorset coast,
or skirting it to Warminster and the west. But the
site of “Ridgeway Bush” is within a few yards
of the westward boundary of Wanborough, and
beyond Wanborough there is so far no sufficient
evidence for tracing the course of the Icknield Way.
The two roads came very near to one another in
that parish; they may even have touched before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
the Ridgeway returned to its own place high up;
and it is possible that as the Ridgeway in Berkshire
has been mistakenly called the Icknield Way, so
the lower part of what is now called the Ridgeway
in Wiltshire may be the Icknield Way.</p>

<span class="smaller">NINTH DAY&mdash;STREATLEY TO EAST HENDRED, BY
UPTON AND HAGBOURNE HILL FARM</span></h2>
</div>


<p>When I started from Streatley to see the western
half of the Icknield Way it was with several uncertainties.
I knew that the Icknield Way was
not the Ridgeway, but a lower road which was
in several places not more than a mile or two away
from it. This lower road, it has been said, was the
Wantage-to-Reading turnpike for part at least of
its course; one writer’s road clearly lay south of
this turnpike; another had expressed a doubt
whether it was the turnpike or a road to the south.
The decision that the Icknield Way in Berkshire
was distinct from the Ridgeway had added this
difficulty; that the Ridgeway, supposing it to have
come up from the ford at Streatley, must have
been a road from beyond the Thames, and what
that road was I had not discovered, though it had
been suggested that it was the Upper Icknield
Way. But if the Icknield Way of Oxfordshire and
the Icknield Way of Berkshire were linked, it must
have been at Streatley, though it may also have
been at other fords.</p>

</a>
<div class="caption"><p>Moulsford Bottom.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The first half-mile of the main road through
Streatley to Wantage is the beginning of the
Ridgeway’s ascent; but a little past the fork to
Wallingford the Ridgeway becomes separate from
this main road, and goes westward out of it. There
was at first no possibility of an alternative out of
Streatley to the west, and I set out on the same
road as when I followed the Ridgeway. On my left
I saw “Lyndhurst,” “Bellevue,” and “Montefiore,”
or their more expensive equivalents. I ignored
the first coombe, the turning up it of the Ridgeway,
and went on upon the roadside grass bordered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
with wormwood and traveller’s joy. Almost at
once the road crossed the entrance to another
coombe running up westward into the Moulsford
Downs, and those woods which the Ridgeway
skirts on the south. It was a shallow coombe,
the sides dappled with thorns, the bottom covered
with corn, and in the midst of it a barn called Well
Barn. Through the mouth of the coombe which
opened towards the river in the east I saw the pale
corn, and the dark woods above it, of the Chilterns.
Crossing this coombe the road had no hedges, but
corn on both sides. It was usually hedgeless,
but banked as it went up and down, and dipped
into another coombe of the same kind called
Moulsford Bottom, where a quarter-mile north
of the thirteenth milestone from Wantage a road
came in from the South Stoke Ferry, the continuation,
perhaps, of a track from the Icknield
Way near Ipsden. From Moulsford Bottom the main
road went visibly curving uphill, but from the top
of Kingstanding Hill, at three hundred feet, it went
straight between its low hedges and grassy banks
towards Blewburton Hill. It had still corn on
both sides in stooks, downs on the left, and on the
right the valley of dark trees stretching far away into
mist. It was a plain, well-kept road of easy gradients,
no corners, and such banks or hedges that anything
approaching in front could be seen. It lacked
the company of telegraph wires.</p>

<p>The villages of Aston were almost completely
hidden on my right, as I passed within a third of
a mile of them. That was by the eleventh milestone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
from Wantage, and there the road was following
along and under one of the low, natural walls
of chalk which so often guide a road and are in
turn defined by it. My road, Icknield Way or not,
went hedgeless under this wall, with oats above and
stubble below. The flowers on its narrow green
edges were chiefly yellow parsnip and white carrot,
both dear for their scents, and succory, that pale
blue flower which a strange fate has closely attached
to the coarsest and stiffest of dark stems and placed
where dust is likely to be most thick.</p>

<p>Here the dust was thick, and I was glad to feel,
to hear, to smell and to taste, and to see the rain falling
as I passed the “Barley Mow” at Blewbury.
According to custom I stood under the broad,
overhanging eaves of one of Blewbury’s thatched
roofs and watched the rain, but it was better to
be in it and to smell the wetted dust which association
alone has made pleasant. Any road was good
now, though mine was an unadventurous, level,
probably commercial, road.</p>

<p>But, rain or no rain, I was looking for an excuse
to leave this road at Upton, the next village, which
is by the ninth milestone. The map had shown
me a road, or an almost continuous line of pieces
running from Upton westward to Lockinge Park,
and on the east possibly connected with the roads
I had already travelled between Little Stoke and
Upton by way of Lollingdon Farm, Aston, and
Blewbury, but traversing land near Upton which is
liable to floods. Either this road or the turnpike
was the Icknield Way, because a more northern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
road would be too low, and no more southern one
had left any traces.</p>

<p>A hundred yards or so before the road I was on
bridged the Didcot, Newbury, and Southampton
Railway I noticed the line of a hedge leaving on
the left at an acute angle, and forming a triangle
with the railway and road for its other sides. As
an old road is not likely to form such triangular
fields, except with the help of a new branch, it
occurred to me that this branching hedge marked
an earlier or original line of the same road, or of
one coming from Upton village, and there connected
with the field roads from Blewbury and
Aston. Across the railway another hedge and a
depression that might once have been a road
continued this line and led naturally into a lane
turning out of the main road on the left beyond the
bridge and passing Upton Vicarage. I supposed
that when the railway cutting was made to have left
these crossing roads in their original state would
have meant making two bridges or one very
broad one necessary. The courses, therefore,
were slightly altered, so that, instead of a crossing
or “four-went way,” there was a road receiving a
branch at one side of the bridge, and a second branch
from an opposite direction, the left, at the other
side. But on referring to the old six-inch Ordnance
Map, made before the railway, I found that I was
mistaken. The amended crossing may have been
made when the old road was superseded by the
turnpike. This left-hand road being the likely-looking
road on the map, I followed it, especially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
as the main road, half a mile beyond, by the “Horse
and Harrow,” at West Hagbourne, took a right-angled
turn which suggested a piecing together of
two older roads, an east-and-west one and a north-and-south
one.</p>

<p>My conjectural road began as a hedged lane that
formed a short cut into the road to East Ilsley and
Newbury. Crossing that road it was a cart track&mdash;with
a disused, parallel course on the right&mdash;over
Hagbourne Hill, past Hagbourne Hill Farm, which
was derelict, but had sunflowers in the garden and
ricks in the yard. Less than a furlong south of
the farm is a supposed Roman burial-ground. A
home-returning carter told me that the first part
of the road as far as the crossing was Baits or Bates
Lane. It was a cart track, or usually a strip of
three or four parallel cart tracks, going parallel with
the downs, and almost straight between one road
and the next that came from over the downs
northward to the villages. It could easily make a
straight course, like all the other roads round about,
because it was on an almost unbroken plateau of
cornland at the foot of the downs: so level was this
piece of country that in about four miles the altitudes
varied only between three hundred and
eighty and four hundred feet. Between me and the
downs there were seldom any trees, except such
few as stood by Downs Farm, its thatched barns,
its old and new ricks. On the right a slight
swell in the land often shut out everything
but distant Oxfordshire under a blue,
bulging threat of storm. The road was for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
most part without hedges, and not a parish
boundary. It was rarely or never sunken, but in
places might have been a little embanked. On one
side, shortly before reaching the Newbury road,
there were two old thorns. Half a mile farther,
after crossing Hungerford Lane&mdash;a track from
Milton Hill to Farnborough&mdash;it had a line of elm
trees on its left, which was part of the enclosure of
Arfield Farm, close by. I thought Arfield&mdash;on the
new one-inch Ordnance Maps spelt Aldfield&mdash;might
be the same as Halvehill. The cottage pronunciation,
except that it lacked an aspirate, was not
discouraging. Halvehill barn was said to be on the
Ickleton Street or Meer, but on inquiry I learnt
that it was some way from my road down Hungerford
Lane to the north, but on this side of the main
road, which was here about a mile distant. This
barn is now called Horn Down Barn.</p>

<p>Past Arfield Farm the road had hedges until it
came to the tussocky little “Arfield Common,”
so called, but perhaps not so in fact. Here there
were several forking cartways. Mine seemed to
go westward along the northern hedge and its
traveller’s joy, but at the west side of the common,
where Cow Lane comes in from Hendred, there was
a gap of a hundred yards or so before the old line
was taken up by a road from the south-east, which
led me into the road to East Hendred. This was a
little more than three miles from the beginning of
the road at Upton.</p>

</a>
<div class="caption"><p>East Hendred.</p></div>
</div>

<p>As I had had as much rain as I wanted on my
skin, I turned downhill under a long train of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
Lombardy poplars and very lanky ash trees into
East Hendred for the night. It was a thatched
village built on the slopes of a little valley, its
houses standing snugly or in short rows high above
either side of the steep streets. They stood high
because the streets were very old and worn into deep
hollows, and at the edges of these ran narrow,
cobbled paths; but the cottages were still higher up,
and four or five stone steps led up from the paths
to their doors. At the bottom stood the towered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
church, telling the hours and the quarters, not
with clock-face and hands, but with bells. Rain,
however, drowned that sweet noise in a mightier
sweetness, heavy and straight rain, and no wind
except what itself created. For half an hour
everything&mdash;trees, mud walls, thatch, old weatherboards,
pale-coloured, timbered cottages, the old
chapel at a crossing railed off as a sign of private
possession&mdash;everything was embedded in rain.
Every sound was the rain. For example, I thought
I heard bacon frying in a room near by, with a noise
almost as loud as the pig made when it was stuck;
but it was the rain pouring steadily off the inn roof.
Then in the dripping quiet afterwards the sunset
blazed in little fragments like gorgeous glass and
metal betwixt the black garden foliage.</p>

<p>Before I went to bed an intelligent, unprejudiced
man told me that the field-way I had followed was
Ickleton Street or&mdash;he said it with some shyness&mdash;Ickleton
Meer. I had asked no leading questions,
so that his name seemed certainly the local though
perhaps not invariable one. From his description
and map knowledge I felt no doubt that this was
the road mentioned in Wise’s <cite>Antiquities of
Berkshire</cite> (1695) as ploughed up in Wantage east
field, but visible from Lockinge Park, eastward
almost the whole way to Upton, through the
parishes of Ardington, East Hendred, Harwell,
and West Hagbourne.</p>

<p>It is strange that that same identification was
not made in a book published in 1905. I mean
Miss Eleanor G. Hayden’s <cite>Travels Round our

Villages</cite>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span> She lived at West Hendred, yet described
her village as lying between two roads known on
the map as the “Portway” (the main road between
Wantage and Reading) and Ickleton Street, adding
that they were known “locally as the ‘Turnpike’
and the ‘Ridgeway.’” Evidently she had not
heard the people talk of “Ickleton Street” or
“Ickleton Meer.” Yet her books prove her familiar
with country people and country places as are few
writers of country books. Her <cite>Travels</cite> and her
<cite>Turnpike Travellers</cite> and <cite>Islands of the Vale</cite> gave
the materials for an exceptionally full picture
of country life. Nothing was beneath her, and her
love was equal to her curiosity. She was exceptionally
modest, and put down everything with no
obvious intention except fidelity to her own eyes
and ears. She could be dull, and if you opened the
book at random you might be disappointed; but
if you read a whole chapter you were certain to be
delighted. So many books are written by bungalow
countrymen that we have got used to pretty things,
surprising things, pathetic things, country equivalents
of the music-halls and museums of towns.
There were plenty of good things in Miss Hayden’s
books. She was not afraid of quoting country
talk at some length for its own sake, but she did
not miss such things as the cottager’s “strutty
little hen,” who was “a deal better Christ’n nor
many what calls themselves sich,” and the lonely
shepherd’s answer to the question what he and
his family did without a doctor&mdash;“We just dies a
nat’ral death.” She appeared to make good books<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
as others darn stockings, because of the abundant
material. She gave a natural monotony and a
natural charm. She showed us a village girl curtseying
seven times to the crescent moon; children
playing with the old mill machinery after the
cheap loaf had killed it; labourers at a tug-of-war
over a brook; a cavalier and lady of the old manor-house;
a crossing stream, a beautiful garden, a
village kitchen, a recipe for Christmas pudding
and one for sloe gin, and many things from old
parish accounts. But nobody bought her books.
If she had given them to some journalist to mince,
spice, warm, and dish up, he might have made a book
of the season from them, and by now it would have
been dead. Hers will last somehow or another as
long as an old wall.</p>

<p>I lay awake listening to the rain, and at first
it was as pleasant to my ear and my mind as it had
long been desired; but before I fell asleep it had
become a majestic and finally a terrible thing,
instead of a sweet sound and symbol. It was accusing
and trying me and passing judgment. Long
I lay still under the sentence, listening to the rain,
and then at last listening to words which seemed
to be spoken by a ghostly double beside me. He
was muttering: The all-night rain puts out summer
like a torch. In the heavy, black rain falling straight
from invisible, dark sky to invisible, dark earth
the heat of summer is annihilated, the splendour
is dead, the summer is gone. The midnight rain
buries it away where it has buried all sound but its
own. I am alone in the dark still night, and my ear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
listens to the rain piping in the gutters and roaring
softly in the trees of the world. Even so will the rain
fall darkly upon the grass over the grave when my
ears can hear it no more. I have been glad of the
sound of rain, and wildly sad of it in the past; but that
is all over as if it had never been; my eye is dull
and my heart beating evenly and quietly; I stir
neither foot nor hand; I shall not be quieter when
I lie under the wet grass and the rain falls, and I
of less account than the grass. The summer is
gone, and never can it return. There will never be
any summer any more, and I am weary of everything.
I stay because I am too weak to go. I
crawl on because it is easier than to stop. I put
my face to the window. There is nothing out there
but the blackness and sound of rain. Neither when
I shut my eyes can I see anything. I am alone.
Once I heard through the rain a bird’s questioning
watery cry&mdash;once only and suddenly. It seemed
content, and the solitary note brought up against
me the order of nature, all its beauty, exuberance,
and everlastingness like an accusation. I am not
a part of nature. I am alone. There is nothing
else in my world but my dead heart and brain
within me and the rain without. Once there was
summer, and a great heat and splendour over the
earth terrified me and asked me what I could show
that was worthy of such an earth. It smote and
humiliated me, yet I had eyes to behold it, and I
prostrated myself, and by adoration made myself
worthy of the splendour. Was I not once blind
to the splendour because there was something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
within me equal to itself? What was it? Love ...
a name! ... a word! ... less than the watery
question of the bird out in the rain. The rain has
drowned the splendour. Everything is drowned
and dead, all that was once lovely and alive in the
world, all that had once been alive and was memorable
though dead is now dung for a future
that is infinitely less than the falling dark rain.
For a moment the mind’s eye and ear pretend to
see and hear what the eye and ear themselves
once knew with delight. The rain denies.
There is nothing to be seen or heard, and there
never was. Memory, the last chord of the lute,
is broken. The rain has been and will be for ever
over the earth. There never was anything but the
dark rain. Beauty and strength are as nothing
to it. Eyes could not flash in it.</p>

<p>I have been lying dreaming until now, and now
I have awakened, and there is still nothing but the
rain. I am alone. The unborn is not more weak or
more ignorant, and like the unborn I wait and wait,
knowing neither what has been nor what is to come,
because of the rain, which is, has been, and must
be. The house is still and silent, and those small
noises that make me start are only the imagination
of the spirit or they are the rain. There is only
the rain for it to feed on and to crawl in. The rain
swallows it up as the sea does its own foam. I will
lie still and stretch out my body and close my eyes.
My breath is all that has been spared by the rain,
and that comes softly and at long intervals, as if
it were trying to hide itself from the rain. I feel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
that I am so little I have crept away into a corner
and been forgotten by the rain. All else has perished
except me and the rain. There is no room for anything
in the world but the rain. It alone is great
and strong. It alone knows joy. It chants monotonous
praise of the order of nature, which I have
disobeyed or slipped out of. I have done evilly
and weakly, and I have left undone. Fool! you
never were alive. Lie still. Stretch out yourself like
foam on a wave, and think no more of good or evil.
There was no good and no evil. There was life and
there was death, and you chose. Now there is
neither life nor death, but only the rain. Sleep
as all things, past, present, and future, lie still and
sleep, except the rain, the heavy, black rain falling
straight through the air that was once a sea of life.
That was a dream only. The truth is that the rain
falls for ever and I am melting into it. Black and
monotonously sounding is the midnight and solitude
of the rain. In a little while or in an age&mdash;for it
is all one&mdash;I shall know the full truth of the words
I used to love, I knew not why, in my days of nature,
in the days before the rain: “Blessed are the dead
that the rain rains on.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XII<br />

<span class="smaller">TENTH DAY&mdash;EAST HENDRED TO WANBOROUGH, BY
LOCKINGE PARK, WANTAGE, ASHBURY, AND
BISHOPSTONE</span></h2>
</div>


<p>On the following morning early I returned to where
I had left my conjectured road, which I shall now
call Ickleton Street, at the crossing half a mile south
of East Hendred Church. The eastern road at the
crossing came from the south-east (out of Hungerford
Lane) and was only for a few hundred yards
in the line of Ickleton Street, falling into it a hundred
yards or so west of Aldfield Common, where I had
lost the road. The western road was apparently
mine, but it was so unimportant for <em>through</em>
traffic that though the eastern road forked on
entering the northern or Hendred road, neither of
the forks ran exactly into Ickleton Street. Between
these forks was a triangular waste of yellow parsnip,
wild carrot, and dock, uneven from digging, and
somewhat above the roads which were sunken by
downhill wearing.</p>

<p>Ickleton Street ran for a third of a mile straight
westward to a cross-track at the East and West
Hendred boundary. It was hedgeless as before, and
being on a slight depression the horizon was often<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
a very near one of corn, topped by a distant bright
cloud or cloud-shaped dark clump of beech. At
this cross-track I had to turn a few yards south
and then westward along a track of the same kind.
Not being sunk, or raised, or hedged, or banked,
or ditched, the road could be ploughed up easily
and its course slightly changed, as here, to serve a
barn. This was Tames Barn, a thatched quadrangle
of new ricks and old barns and sheds built
of boards now heavily lichened. Past the barn it
went as before, flat and hard-beaten, with broad
ruts, and a slight dip on the right side&mdash;a wall not
half as deep as the corn was high; there were a few
blackthorns on this side. On the left sheep were
folded in clover. Ahead the Lockinge Woods showed
their tops between the rounds of Roundabout Hill,
which was newly reaped, and Goldbury Hill, which
was part stubble, part aftermath. At the first
turning to West Hendred, which made the road
crook a little to the south&mdash;and in this crook&mdash;there
were two or three rough sarsens, iron-coloured but
blotched with orange and dull silver, lying deep in
the grass. A little way back I had noticed another
on the left, and there was another, I think, east of
Arfield Farm, beside the track.</p>

<p>Past the second turning to West Hendred (from
East Ginge) the tiny dip or wall below the right side
of the road became a pleasant, high, green wall
with blackthorns and elders on it, and the road was
a green one, flowery with scabious, and had a
bank above it, with barley at the edge. Then the
little Ginge brook and its hollow of elms and ash<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
trees interrupted the road. But a few yards beyond
it was clear again where the hard road went at right
angles away from it to Red Barn. It was now
above its green bank, and this was eight or ten
feet high with blackthorns on it. It curved slightly
round the southern base of Roundabout Hill between
the stubble, and being joined by a track
from the south it was worn almost grassless. After
crossing a track to Ardington, it was slightly raised
above the fields on both sides. A hard road joined
it, and it was hardened itself and had a line of young
beeches and elms on each side. This was to lead
up to one of the gates of Lockinge Park, which it
entered and disappeared. It must have been bent&mdash;probably
southward&mdash;by the swelling land of the
park, but over two centuries of ploughing have left
nothing of it visible on the surface.</p>

<p>I turned sharply southward at the edge of this
park and presently back to the north-west, past
a house of great size with some conservatories, elms,
lawns, and water garden&mdash;the shadowy and bright
grass occupied at that hour by a lap-dog and many
swallows. The road, lined on both sides by trees
and overhung by valerian and rose-of-Sharon, had
an unpleasant sense of privacy meant for others.</p>

<p>The turning eastward out of this road by East
Lockinge post office was in line with Ickleton Street,
but signs of an exit from the park on the opposite
side of the road were obliterated by cottages and
gardens. This turning I took, and when it curved
decidedly to the right a footpath on the left, between
a hedge and some allotment gardens, pre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>served
its original line. This path led westward
into a road coming south from Goddard’s Barn. On
the right-hand side of the entering of the path into
this road lay the good house of West Lockinge
Farm, its barn and sheds and lodges gathered
about it on one side of the road, and its ricks and
elm trees opposite. The road was half farm-yard
and half road and littered with straw and husks,
where the fowls were stalking and pecking with a
laziness that seemed perfectly suited to a Sunday
early morning following a blazing harvest Saturday.</p>

</a>
<div class="caption"><p>Port Way, Wantage.</p></div>
</div>

<p>I hoped to find a cart track going west from the
other side of this road. For about a quarter of a
mile I thought I found it raised a little in the stubble.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
It had been sown and reaped like the rest of the
field, but it was a little weedier and grassier. It
was making over the swelling arable for Lark Hill
and the south edge of Wantage, but I could not
find it in the clover nor in the barley beyond that.
I therefore turned north into Round Hill, a straight
piece of hard road going west into Wantage, with
no hedges but grassy borders between it and the
arable on either side. This may be the Icknield
Way or its successor. It led into the main road
at the edge of Wantage, and this I followed into
the town. In the first few yards I noticed the sign
of the “Lord Nelson” on the left. I recognized it
as the work of that venerable artist who designs the
faces of guys and turnip-men all over the country.
I could tell that the man upon the signboard was
Nelson because the uniform corresponded to the
name painted below. The face was as much like
Nelson as King George III, and it was entirely
different from that on the other side of the board.
Nevertheless, the effort was to be preferred to a
more accurate portrait painted by a builder and
decorator’s man from a picture in a history book.
It was an effort to represent an image of a hero.
The builder and decorator’s man would have aimed
simply at reproducing something which impressed
him because it was in a printed book: his horses
do not represent what he knows or feels about
horses, but what he is able to crib from a photographer
in a book advertising somebody’s food or
embrocation; his “Coach and Horses” is painful
to see, because it ought obviously to be in a book.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
May it be long before he is allowed to molest the
shape of the horse or dragon carved into the turf
of White Horse Hill. In its present shape it could
not be used to advertise horse food or embrocation:
but the horse above Alton Priors could be so used
and doubtless one day will be.</p>

<p>As I was leaving Wantage I heard a blackbird
singing in a garden beyond the church. This was
near the middle of August and a full month since I
had last heard one. The heat had dried up the
birds’ songs all much earlier than usual, and now
the rain of the last night seemed to be reviving one.
The song was perfect and as strange a thing as last
year’s snow.</p>

<p>Crossing the Letcombe brook I was out again
between hedges and in the company of telegraph
posts on the road to Ashbury, Bishopstone, and
Swindon, which is called in the inch Ordnance Map
“Roman Way.” It seemed the only continuation
of Ickleton Street, and as there was no other road
with anything like the same course in the valley I
had little doubt that it was the “Icleton-way”
of the early eighteenth century going “all
under the hills between them and Childrey,
Sparsholt and Uffington, so under White
Horse Hill, leaving Woolston and Compton
on the right, thence to Ashbury and
Bishopston.” The foot of the Downs was about a
mile on the left, and between them and the road
the cornland dipped considerably. Looking over
the hedge I saw first a broad land of grass and then
a line of telegraph wires making for Letcombe and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
dividing the grass from a broad band of ripe corn;
beyond that was a band of very green roots; then
a band of newly ploughed earth; then stubble
dappled with dark corn stacks, and above them
the hill.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 550px;">

</a>
<div class="caption"><p>Under White Horse Hill.</p></div>
</div>

<p>My road was a narrow one, and at first borderless
and worn to some depth below the neighbouring
fields. At the top of its ascent out of Wantage it
had a bank on the right, a fence on the left instead
of hedges. After passing Ickleton House at a right-hand
turning, I reached two cottages on the right at
the crossing of a road from Faringdon to Letcombe.
This I entered on the south side to look for a road
between mine and the hills. A parish boundary
follows this road, and also the lane which I turned
into on the right almost at once. The lane was
green and ran under some beeches and a natural
turf wall south-westward. It was deep worn and
rutted as it descended through the corn and barley
to a cross-track under another turf wall making
from Letcombe Regis Church to Childrey. I went
on until my track became a hard road to Lambourn,
and as I had seen no sign of an alternative to the
“Roman Way,” I turned to the right and entered
it again at the crossing for Childrey and Letcombe
Bassett. Elms clustered at the crossing, and the
road was deeply worn between grassy banks. It
continued to have hardly any green edge, and as it
was usually rising or falling it was sunk more or
less below its original level; in one place, for example,
the left bank was nearly twenty feet high,
and I could see nothing but the clouds all sopped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
in sunlight. The land was almost entirely arable
on either side, with standing corn or stooks or
stubble. In one place, past the turning on the
right to Westcott, which is between Sparsholt and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
Kingston Lisle, the road was on a terrace, having a
bank on the left and falling on the right to corn and
a thatched farm under trees: there were elms and
beeches on either side, but no hedge. The trees of
Lisle Park gave lines of handsome beeches to either
side of the road, trees of less than a hundred years,
all well-shaped and, in fact, almost uniform, and
planted at reasonable intervals. The ridge of the
Downs was not a mile distant, and from it the grass
of a yellowish green colour undulated without a
break to the road, sprinkled with beeches and barred
with fir plantations. Past the Blowingstone Hill
and the turning to Kingston Lisle these undulations
are bare and carved by a steep-walled natural
cutting. At this point the top of the Downs was
only half a mile away, and thenceforward it was
never more than a mile until beyond Bishopstone.
Actually the nearest point to the ridge was perhaps
where the road twisted sharp to the left to the
bottom of a coombe and then sharp back again to
get out of it. As the floor of the coombe sloped upwards
into the hill, these twists gave a road which
was bound to cross it at the lowest possible gradient.
The coombe had steep, smooth sides of yellowish
grass and a winding flat floor, and through the big
scattered thorns and elders of it a track went down
to Fawler. The road wound again to round a high
bank on the left and again to circumvent a thorny
hollow on the right, and soon the White Horse was
coming into view. There were woods steep above
on the left; there had been hedges on both sides
since Blowingstone Hill, often bushy and thick and<span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
overscrambled by climbers, as, for example, near
Britchcombe Farm. Here the road had a green,
sunken course divided from the hard one by a
thicket. This farm-house and its thatched, white-stone
dependencies, their trees, their elders and
nettles, stood close to the road, but a little back
from it and a little above it, under the almost
precipitous ash wood of the hill; and away from it
on the other side of the road sloped another coombe
of thorns, and also of willows and some water.</p>

</a>
<div class="caption"><p>Dragon Hill.</p></div>
</div>

<p>A little past Britchcombe Farm the Dragon Hill
came in sight above a slope of oats and yellowed
grass. Then the road twisted again, left and right,
to cross another coombe, grown with larch trees
on its lower half and having a pool in it near
Woolstone Lodge; but the upper half bending
back under the Dragon Hill, with a few thorns on its
steep and furrowed walls. Rising up out of the
coombe, as usual the road was between steep banks,
and on them thorn bushes, scabious, and meadow
crane’s-bill flowers.</p>

<p>At the crossing to Shrivenham and Lambourn I
caught sight of the crest and haggard beech clump of
Barbury above the nearer hills. This crossing was
within a quarter of a mile of Compton Beauchamp,
the last of more than half a dozen villages which the
road passed by on its right hand without touching.
Ashbury was the first village traversed by the road
since Upton. As I approached Ashbury through
corn that now ran right to the top of the Downs, I
had a bank above me on the left and one below me
on the right, and I could see now both Liddington<span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
and Barbury clumps, and to the left of Liddington
one high, bare breast of turf. A lesser road turned
down to Odstone Farm, which I was very glad to
see again, not a quarter of a mile on my right&mdash;its
five plain windows in a row, two in the roof, and
those below not to be counted because of the garden
shrubs. It was a grey, stone house with a steep,
grey roof and a chimney stack at either side; there
were elms behind it, and tiled and thatched sheds
all on its right hand; and the road going straight
down to its left side.</p>

</a>
<div class="caption"><p>Green Terrace, near Ashbury.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The right-hand hedge gave way to show me the
elms and thatched barns and ricks of Ashbury, its
church tower among trees rather apart and nearer
the Downs. The road descended under a steep left-hand
bank, with a green course parallel. It turned
right and then left round some elm trees and past
a hollow on the right containing a broad millpond
enclosed in a parallelogram of elms. At Ashbury
the road turned to the right away from the church
to the “Rose and Crown,” and the two elm trees
standing in mid-street, and then back again to the
left into its original line. But parallel with the
road a footpath ran from the church on a terrace
just wide enough for a waggon. It had a green wall
above and below, grass on the left, sweet-smelling
lucerne on the right. It rose and fell more than the
road as it made for Idstone between the barley.
The terrace seemed to be continued across the
deeply worn road from Swinley Down; but the
path turned to the right and into the main road.
This terrace road seemed to be a very possible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
course for an old, though perhaps only an alternative
road.</p>

<p>I stopped for a little time at Ashbury, and asking
for tea at a cottage and shop combined, I was asked
into a silent but formidable Sunday assembly of
three incompatible and hostile but respectful
generations: a severe but cheerful grandmother in
black and spectacles with one finger still marking a
place in the Bible; a preoccupied, morose mother,
also in black; a depressed but giddy daughter
fresh from the counter of a London shop, and already
wondering what she was going to do at Ashbury.
This girl poured out my tea and told me that there
were some very good apples on the tree next door.
Neither she nor her relatives, because it was Sunday,
could buy these or in any way procure them, so she
told me, though she had begun to want them very
much after half a day at her native village; if I
went&mdash;and there seemed no objection to the damnation
of a casual wayfarer&mdash;I could probably get
some. The old lady who lived in the cottage next
door said, as if she were stating a well-known fact
in the natural history of Ashbury, that she had no
apples, that they were very troublesome to knock
down, that none had fallen from the trees during
the day, and that&mdash;she was perfectly certain&mdash;there
would be none until the morrow. On the morrow I
hoped to be many miles from Ashbury, and so I
wished her a good afternoon in spite of the rigid
sabbatarianism of her trees. I returned to the
cottage where I had been drinking tea and told the
girl that no apples would fall until Monday morning,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
and asked her if she knew any other kind of apple
trees in Ashbury. Perhaps it was as well that she
did not, for I found that Sunday’s tea cost twice
as much as Saturday’s or Monday’s&mdash;it being apparently
the right of the righteous to prey upon the
damned, even if in so doing they put themselves
into a position apparently as graceless as that of the
damned. I thought of asking a clergyman if this
was so, and seeing a man whom I took to be a clergyman,
because his collar was fastened behind instead
of in front, I walked after him. But he suddenly
stopped and went into the very cottage of the old
lady whose apples would not fall before Monday
morning, and this looked so like a conspiracy that I
hastened away, glad to have made these discoveries
in the natural history of Ashbury.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>Coombe at Bishopstone.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The deeply worn road from Swinley Down cut
across my road, south of the green terrace road, at
Idstone, and sent it northwards twenty yards or
so, just as Akeman Street cutting across the Upper
and Lower Icknield Ways near Tring sent each
nearly a mile northwards. After this I could see no
trace of the little terrace road, though it was
possibly marked by a bank dividing the next fields
to the road from those beyond, and then by a
mere division between crops to a point above or
beyond Bishopstone. Half-way between Idstone
and Bishopstone the road entered Wiltshire without
ceremony. At the turning just before reaching
Bishopstone the road was worn very deep, and
above it a steep-walled, bare coombe ran up into
the Downs with a track along its edge. More often<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
than not after leaving Wantage the road had been
worn thus deep, because it traversed a country of
numerous and abrupt undulations; these made
fairly steep ascents and descents necessary, and they
invariably mean the hollowing out of any unmetalled,
i.e. of any ancient and not Roman road. The plough
could never do any harm to this road. But the
“Port Way” between Wantage and Streatley it
could hide from most eyes in a few seasons. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
Ickleton Street between Upton and Lockinge Park
would almost disappear under a single ploughing,
and doubtless often has done so, to reappear in the
same or a parallel course when needed.</p>

<p>At Bishopstone the road twisted right and left
almost as at Ashbury. This was into a coombe
with a little stream in it, and there were some signs
that the old way had rather been left and right&mdash;that
is, sloping down to the ascending bottom of the
coombe and up again&mdash;as in other coombes. But
the coombe and the bare Downs about it were so
shaped by nature, by wearing, and apparently by
deliberate but inexplicable cutting, that a mere
road could not be traced with certainty. The
coombe branched as it rose up into the Downs and
formed several enormous convexities and concavities
of turf. Several of their converging slopes
were cut evenly into three or four, or nearly a dozen,
green terraces like staircases, all of which, had a
company of giants sat there, would have given a
view of the spring-head below.</p>

<p>Sheep were strewn over some of these terraces,
making arrangements of white dots of a fascinating
irregularity. Unless it has become a trick, only a
great artist could make similar arrangements of
equal beauty. The unknown laws which produce
these inevitable accidents are great managers of
the beautiful. The succession of bays in an island
coast and the general form of the island itself&mdash;of
course, particularly of islands off our own coast&mdash;are
beautiful in their way. The shape of England
and Wales, the shape of Ireland, of Man, and of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
whole flock of the Hebrides please me with their
unity, fascinate me with their complexity; a
mistaken map of any such known place is as bad
æsthetically as geographically. Children are fond
of inventing islands with marvellous inlets more
romantic than anything on the west coast of
Scotland or Scandinavia. But I have never
seen one of these invented islands that I
could like apart from its creator, or its
names, or its sites marked “Buried gold,”
and so on. They are incredible and raise no
wonder. They are not masters’ work. I do not
know if geologists can support me, but Leonardo’s
Cave in “The Virgin of the Rocks” always makes
me uneasy by what seems to me to be its artificial
impossibility. Another great picture which is, I
think, faulty in a similar way reminds me of another
beauty&mdash;the beauty of the scattering and gathering
of the stars. I never look at Titian’s “Bacchus and
Ariadne” without feeling the constellation in that
glorious purple is an unhappy invention. It may
be my poor astronomy, but I should be inclined to
say that stars never could be spread exactly as
they are in that picture. It is not merely that
there is (I believe) no such constellation, but that
the form is one which, for some reason, they would
avoid, though by picking a star here and a star
there it might be patched up. Birds always fly and
fishing-boats always sail in these just patterns.
Some are so just that, like that of the sheep above
Bishopstone, I should like to have them copied on
paper to look at for their mystical arithmetic.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span></p>

<p>The village, the mill, and the church were lower
down to the right below the spring, on the modern
road and its northward branches. Only a cottage,
with a thatched roof on a level with my feet, lay
near the green coombe track above the water.
The road went on again between corn and roots,
westwards now, and gradually farther from the
Downs, until a cross-road from Bourton cut across
it and sent it southwards a quarter-mile by a willowy
spring before it turned west again.</p>

<p>This road southward into the Marlborough and
Hungerford road may yet be shown to be part
of the Icknield Way. For at Totterdown, a mile
and a half beyond, it curves round and makes a
line with the road to Chisledon under Liddington
Hill&mdash;the road much resembling the Icknield Way
which is called “Ridgeway” on the maps. It
rose now, a hedged and elmy road, to five hundred
feet, and had a deep, grassy hollow and elm trees
below, between it and the cornland of the Downs.
It dipped to a spring and a post office at Hinton
Parva; it dipped again and rose to a view over the
northern vale to the dim, watery wall of the Cotswolds.
At this height it crossed Ermine Street
just after passing a “Black Horse.” All four ways
at the crossing were deeply worn and made a pit
with bushy banks and tiny green triangles of waste
in the midst.</p>

<p>In a quarter-mile past the crossing of Ermine
Street I was at Wanborough. There the road forked
at the “Calley Arms.” There is not a scrap of
real or pretended documentary evidence for either<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
road, at least until the place-names mentioned
in the Saxon charter relating to Wanborough
have been identified. The left-hand road had the
advantage of keeping near the hills, instead of going
clean away west like the right-hand one. This
right-hand road may at last be connected with one
of those rumoured roads going westwards, under
the secondary line of chalk hills, past Holy Cross at
Swindon, past Elcombe and Studley to St. Anne’s-in-the-Wood
at Brislington, in Somerset, or to
Devonshire; and this continuation may at last be
shown to be entitled to the name of Icknield Way.
I followed the left-hand road because it seemed
possible to connect it with one, very much like the
Icknield Way and in a similar relation to the
Downs, going south-westward through Wroughton
and Broad Hinton, and from there either to Avebury
or to Yatesbury, and so by Juggler’s Lane to
Cherhill on its way to Bath.</p>

<p>Liddington clump, the straight ridge and the
“castle” rampart upon it, were clear ahead as
I took this turning. Wanborough’s towered and
spired church stood at the top of a slope of grass
on my right. It was a crooked, hedged road,
with a grassy edge and a path on the grass; and
the telegraph posts followed it. It passed out of
Wanborough parish at a tiny stream that crossed
the road in a deep, narrow cleft with willows and
willow herbs below on the right, and in the widening
cleft a derelict mill, a steep garden plot, and a row
of beehives. It rose up narrow, deep, and steep to
the “Bell” at Liddington. There I turned to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
left into the Swindon road, and almost at once to
the left again, leaving the church on my left. This
took me past two or three houses of Medbourne,
and sharp to the left and right through the hamlet
of Badbury, where a great elm stands at the first
turning above a deep hollow and a road going
northward down it to the right. Then crossing the
Roman road from Mildenhall to Wanborough
Nythe, I was at Chisledon and another cleft in the
land. This cleft is often precipitous, and so narrow
that you could almost play cards across it. A
streamlet and a single line of railway wind along
the bottom. The church stands at the edge where
it is gentler, and the village is scattered over the
slopes and edges.</p>

<p>I was hungry when I knocked at the door of the
first inn at half-past five. On the opposite side of
the road a small, quiet crowd of drinkers in black
coats and hats waited to be let in at six. No one
answered my knock. I knocked louder, and still
louder, on the woodwork of the door. Then I
rapped the glass, and rapped louder and many times.
But no one came, and as I was too hungry to want
justice I went to the next inn. Here the door was
instantly opened by a little red-faced landlady
with fuzzy hair and a gnomish face. She was
swift and clean, and so light and quick was her step
that every time I heard her approaching I expected
a child. She was sorry to say that she had no bed
to spare, but told me of someone that might. I
tried in vain, then called opposite where “refreshments”
were advertised. An enormous woman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
stood wedged in the doorway; she was black-haired,
sullen, and faintly moustached, and she had her
hands hanging down because there was no room on
either side of her to clasp them, and no room in
the doorway for her to rest them upon the fat
superincumbent upon her hips. I said good evening,
and she remained silent. I asked her if she had a
bed to spare. She looked me up and down with a
movement of head and eyes, and asked me gradually
where I came from. I was so taken aback that
I told her like a child, “From East Hendred”&mdash;which
was absurd. She retreated to ask her husband.
He appeared alone, and hanging down his
head, shook it, and said that he did not think he
could spare me a bed. Having no gift of speech,
I turned very rapidly away from him and back to
the inn. The landlady thought of someone else,
made inquiries, and assured me that the bed would
be ready when Mrs. Somebody got back from church.
So I went out and looked at Burderop, Ladder Hill,
and the turning “To the Downs and Rockley.”
The woman was back from church and opened the
door to me. She had a background of women
taking off Sunday hats and putting away veils and
prayer-books, and said she was sorry, but a niece
had come, and there was no room for me. In the
darkening street I saw an old man at a gate with a
genial face and the mouth of one accustomed to
horses. I asked him if he knew of a bed to spare.
“No&mdash;oh-oh-oh&mdash;no,” he chuckled, with increased
geniality. “You’ve come to the wrong place....
Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho no,” he continued. “I can’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
tell you why; but if you want a bed you have to
go to a town.” He was only a visitor to Chisledon,
and I wished him better treatment than I had got.
I set out for Swindon. In about a mile I came to
another inn, where I had always enjoyed the bread
and cheese and ale, and I unwillingly silenced a
black-coated company of grave drinkers standing
at the bar. They suspended their glasses while
the landlord said that it was absolutely impossible
to get a bed that side of Swindon. I tried at Coate.
The barmaid appealed to Mr. MacFaggart, who was
standing by&mdash;“Perhaps Mrs. MacFaggart can spare
a bed?” “No.” This series of refusals was, I am
convinced, pure ill-luck. But the stout woman
refused me, almost beyond doubt, because I was
a stranger whom she could not immediately classify.
I could not be classed as a “gentleman,” as a young
“gent” or “swell,” or as a plain “young fellow.”
She decided not to risk it. Perhaps she had savings
about the house. Or did she think that underneath
less than two days’ beard, that oldish and not very
clean Burberry waterproof, those good but very
baggy trousers, murder was lurking? No, probably
she felt not the very slightest inclination to please
me, and as it only meant half a crown, her one
difficulty in refusing was her natural sullenness
increased by the presence of the nondescript and
unsympathetic casual stranger on a Sunday. Country
people know a country gentleman, a sporting
financier, a tradesman, a young townsman (clerk
or artisan), a working man, and a real tramp or
roadster. Some of them know the artist or dis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>tinguished
foreigner, with a foot of hair, broad-brimmed
hat, and corduroy or soft tweeds, a cloak
and an ostentatious pipe, tasselled, or of enormous
bulk, or elaborate form or unusual substance.
Some know the hairy and hygienic man in sandals.
To be elbowed out at nightfall after a day’s walking
by an unconscious conspiracy of a whole village
was enough to produce either a hate of Chisledon or
a belief that the devil or a distinguished relative
was organizing the opposition. But during
those four unexpected miles to Swindon in
the volcanic heat of evening, which produced
several pains and a constant struggle between
impatient mind and dull, tired body, I felt chiefly:
I suffer; I do not want to suffer; and only now and
then the face of Mrs. Stout, or of Mrs. Smallbeer,
or of the genial old man with the horsy mouth,
came into my head, and turned my depression to
fury.</p>

<p>Possibly they were afraid of German spies at
Chisledon. Not far from Maidstone in the summer
of 1910 some poor cottage children were telling me
how a German spy wanted to rob them of the
lunch they were taking to school. He was a dark
stranger with a beard, and he was waiting about at
a crossing partly overhung by trees; and they were
convinced that he wished to steal their food, and
that his reason for doing so was his position as
German spy.</p>

<p>At Swindon I felt what a man feels in a place
where he knows one man instead of knowing scores
of children and feeling that every passing stranger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
was of the same family, ready at a touch to be
changed to a friend. But I had no difficulty in
finding a bed surrounded by the following decorations:
pictures of ships in quiet and in roaring
seas; of roses twining about the words, “The
Lord shall be thy everlasting light”; of a cart-horse
going through a ford with three children on
his back; of an Italian boatman and three buxom
girls, one clinking glasses with him; advertisements
of an aperient and of cheap cigarettes.
The advertisement of cigarettes dwarfed all the
rest. For not only was the lettering large, but
there was also a coloured picture of a swarthy and
hearty woman practically naked to the waist.
She was smiling with her dark eyes, and her lips
were parted. I could not imagine what she had to
do with cigarettes of any kind. Was there a kind
of suggestion that these bold, bad, under-dressed
foreign beauties&mdash;undoubtedly beauties&mdash;were
capable of smoking the cigarettes? Or was the
picture meant to be a stimulus to some, a satisfaction
to others, of those who sat at their ease drinking
and smoking and thinking of women? In the taproom
of the most rustic public houses two or three
of these women sometimes adorn the walls, along
with a picture of a diseased cow and of its mouth,
stomach, and udder. Some are dark, some are
fair, and, I think, certainly meant to be English;
but all are incompletely draped and unashamed.
The dark ones are vaunting heathen beauties, the
fair tend to be insipid, with expressions borrowed
from the pious virgins of religious pictures. Some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>times
the Bacchante and the pious virgin are to be
seen side by side, the sacred one being supplied by
the village grocer at Christmas. They are equally
beautiful, i.e. have regular features, perfect complexions,
and expressionless mouths, and are doing
nothing in particular except posing so that the
artist shall observe their bosoms, or, in the case
of sacred pictures, their throats and the whites of
their eyes. I do not think it could be shown that
these pictures spoil the chances of girls with unclassical
features and cross-eyes in the villages.
In these matters the moth that desires the star
is likely to end in a candle flame, whether or not
he mistook it for a star. In these new towns I
see women looking as if they were made in the
chemists’ shops, which are so numerous and
conspicuous in the streets&mdash;thin, pallid, dyspeptic,
vampirine beauties, having nothing but sex in
common with the bold, swarthy alien on the cigarette
advertisement....</p>

<p>At Swindon the explorer of the Icknield Way
has all the world before him. He may go through
Marlborough into the Pewsey Valley, and either
along under the hills through Lavington to Westbury,
or, turning out of the Pewsey Valley, to Old Sarum,
and beyond Westbury or Sarum into the extreme
west; and he will be on a road of the same type
as the Icknield Way for the greater part of the
distance. Or he may content himself with reaching
Avebury. Or he may miss Avebury and aim at
Bath. At present documents and traditions keep
a perfect silence west of Wanborough, and among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
mere possibilities the choice is endless. The easiest,
the pleasantest, and the wrongest thing to do is to
take to the Ridgeway at Wanborough and follow
it along the supposed south-westerly course under
Liddington Hill, under Barbury Castle, and then
up on to the ridge to Avebury. But though it is
possible that in the Middle Ages this was done,
there is little doubt that the green way going
high up on the ridge past Glory Ann Barn
is not coeval with, is not the same road as, the
hill-foot road that has crept persistently but humbly
under the Chilterns and Berkshire Downs. Such
a road ran more risks than the Ridgeway from the
plough. Its preservation between Upton and
Lockinge Park is miraculous. It might easily have
disappeared in the ploughland about Chisledon
or the rich pastures of Coate. Let the conjecturer
thus skip a few miles in his westerly or south-westerly
course, and he can go rapidly ahead,
following under the main ridge to Avebury, or under
the secondary ridge, three or four miles north of it,
towards Calne and Bath. It is a game of skill which
deserves a select reputation&mdash;to find an ancient
road of the same character as the Oxfordshire and
Berkshire Icknield Way, going west or south-west
beyond Wanborough. The utmost reward of this
conjecturing traveller would be to find himself on
the banks of the Towy or beside the tomb of
Giraldus at St. David’s itself.</p>

<p>Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE<br />
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK</h2>

<p>To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.</p>

<h3>Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works</h3>

<p>1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.</p>

<p>1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</p>

<p>1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:</p>

<p>1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
  it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with
  this eBook or online
  at <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

<p>1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>

<p>1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.</p>

<p>1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.</p>

<p>1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

<p>1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>

<p>1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

<p>1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.</p>

<p>1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.</p>

<p>1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.  </p>

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.</p>

<p>The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to
date contact information can be found at the Foundation's web site and
official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact</p>

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
